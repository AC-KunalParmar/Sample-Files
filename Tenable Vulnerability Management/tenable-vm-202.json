A user located in the local network or     with a high bandwidth connection can increase the CPU usage of the server that accepts IPV6 connections up     to 95%. (CVE-2023-1206)\n\n  - A side channel vulnerability on some of the AMD CPUs may allow an attacker to influence the return address     prediction. This may result in speculative execution at an attacker-controlled address, potentially     leading to information disclosure. (CVE-2023-20569)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the networking subsystem of the Linux kernel within the handling of the RPL protocol.\n    This issue results from the lack of proper handling of user-supplied data, which can lead to an assertion     failure. This may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to create a denial of service condition on the     system. (CVE-2023-2156)\n\n  - A null pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's DECnet networking protocol. This issue     could allow a remote user to crash the system. (CVE-2023-3338)\n\n  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.10. fs/smb/server/smb2misc.c in ksmbd does not     validate the relationship between the command payload size and the RFC1002 length specification, leading     to an out-of-bounds read. (CVE-2023-38432)\n\n  - A use-after-free flaw was found in nfc_llcp_find_local in net/nfc/llcp_core.c in NFC in the Linux kernel.\n    This flaw allows a local user with special privileges to impact a kernel information leak issue.\n    (CVE-2023-3863)\n\n  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the siano smsusb module in the Linux kernel. The bug occurs     during device initialization when the siano device is plugged in. This flaw allows a local user to crash     the system, causing a denial of service condition. (CVE-2023-4132)\n\n  - A flaw was found in KVM AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) in the Linux kernel. A KVM guest using     SEV-ES or SEV-SNP with multiple vCPUs can trigger a double fetch race condition vulnerability and invoke     the `VMGEXIT` handler recursively. If an attacker manages to call the handler multiple times, they can     trigger a stack overflow and cause a denial of service or potentially guest-to-host escape in kernel     configurations without stack guard pages (`CONFIG_VMAP_STACK`). (CVE-2023-4155)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TUN/TAP functionality. This issue could allow a local user to     bypass network filters and gain unauthorized access to some resources. The original patches fixing     CVE-2023-1076 are incorrect or incomplete. The problem is that the following upstream commits -     a096ccca6e50 (tun: tun_chr_open(): correctly initialize socket uid), - 66b2c338adce (tap: tap_open():\n    correctly initialize socket uid), pass inode->i_uid to sock_init_data_uid() as the last parameter and     that turns out to not be accurate. (CVE-2023-4194)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the exFAT driver of the Linux kernel. The vulnerability exists in the implementation     of the file name reconstruction function, which is responsible for reading file name entries from a     directory index and merging file name parts belonging to one file into a single long file name. Since the     file name characters are copied into a stack variable, a local privileged attacker could use this flaw to     overflow the kernel stack. (CVE-2023-4273)\n\n  - An issue was discovered in net/ceph/messenger_v2.c in the Linux kernel before 6.4.5. There is an integer     signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow and remote code execution via HELLO or one of the AUTH     frames. This occurs because of an untrusted length taken from a TCP packet in ceph_decode_32.\n    (CVE-2023-44466)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.","exploit_available":true,"exploit_framework_canvas":false,"exploit_framework_core":false,"exploit_framework_d2_elliot":false,"exploit_framework_exploithub":false,"exploit_framework_metasploit":false,"exploitability_ease":"Exploits

remote Ubuntu 20.04 LTS / 22.04 LTS host has a package installed that is affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the USN-6609-1 advisory.\n\n  - An out-of-bounds access vulnerability involving netfilter was reported and fixed as: f1082dd31fe4     (netfilter: nf_tables: Reject tables of unsupported family); While creating a new netfilter table, lack of     a safeguard against invalid nf_tables family (pf) values within `nf_tables_newtable` function enables an     attacker to achieve out-of-bounds access. (CVE-2023-6040)\n\n  - An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in smbCalcSize in fs/smb/client/netmisc.c in the Linux     Kernel. This issue could allow a local attacker to crash the system or leak internal kernel information.\n    (CVE-2023-6606)\n\n  - A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to     achieve local privilege escalation. The function nft_pipapo_walk did not skip inactive elements during set     walk which could lead double deactivations of PIPAPO (Pile Packet Policies) elements, leading to use-     after-free. We recommend upgrading past commit 317eb9685095678f2c9f5a8189de698c5354316a. (CVE-2023-6817)\n\n  - A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Performance Events system component can be     exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. A perf_event's read_size can overflow, leading to an heap     out-of-bounds increment or write in perf_read_group(). We recommend upgrading past commit     382c27f4ed28f803b1f1473ac2d8db0afc795a1b. (CVE-2023-6931)\n\n  - A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's ipv4: igmp component can be exploited to achieve     local privilege escalation. A race condition can be exploited to cause a timer be mistakenly registered on     a RCU read locked object which is freed by another thread. We recommend upgrading past commit     e2b706c691905fe78468c361aaabc719d0a496f1. (CVE-2023-6932)\n\n  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel. If the catchall element is     garbage-collected when the pipapo set is removed, the element can be deactivated twice.

host has a package installed that is affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the USN-6549-1 advisory.\n\n  - An issue was discovered in the USB subsystem in the Linux kernel through 6.4.2. There is an out-of-bounds     and crash in read_descriptors in drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c. (CVE-2023-37453)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's IP framework for transforming packets (XFRM subsystem). This issue     may allow a malicious user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to cause a 4 byte out-of-bounds read of     XFRMA_MTIMER_THRESH when parsing netlink attributes, leading to potential leakage of sensitive heap data     to userspace. (CVE-2023-3773)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The nfnl_osf_add_callback function did     not validate the user mode controlled opt_num field. This flaw allows a local privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN)     attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash or information disclosure. (CVE-2023-39189)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The xt_u32 module did not validate the     fields in the xt_u32 structure. This flaw allows a local privileged attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds     read by setting the size fields with a value beyond the array boundaries, leading to a crash or     information disclosure. (CVE-2023-39192)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The sctp_mt_check did not validate the     flag_count field. This flaw allows a local privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds     read, leading to a crash or information disclosure. (CVE-2023-39193)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the XFRM subsystem in the Linux kernel. The specific flaw exists within the processing     of state filters, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. This flaw allows a local     privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to an     information disclosure. (CVE-2023-39194)\n\n  - A race condition was found in the QXL driver in the Linux kernel. The qxl_mode_dumb_create() function     dereferences the qobj returned by the qxl_gem_object_create_with_handle(), but the handle is the only one     holding a reference to it. This flaw allows an attacker to guess the returned handle value and trigger a     use-after-free issue, potentially leading to a denial of service or privilege escalation. (CVE-2023-39198)\n\n  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel ipv4 stack. The socket buffer (skb) was     assumed to be associated with a device before calling __ip_options_compile, which is not always the case     if the skb is re-routed by ipvs. This issue may allow a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to crash     the system. (CVE-2023-42754)\n\n  - A flaw was found in vringh_kiov_advance in drivers/vhost/vringh.c in the host side of a virtio ring in the     Linux Kernel. This issue may result in a denial of service from guest to host via zero length descriptor.\n    (CVE-2023-5158)\n\n  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in drivers/nvme/target/tcp.c` in `nvmet_tcp_free_crypto` due to a     logical bug in the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem in the Linux kernel. This issue may allow a malicious local     privileged user to cause a use-after-free and double-free problem, which may permit remote code execution     or lead to local privilege escalation problem. (CVE-2023-5178)\n\n  - A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Linux Kernel Performance Events (perf)     component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. If perf_read_group() is called while an     event's sibling_list is smaller than its child's sibling_list, it can increment or write to memory     locations outside of the allocated buffer. We recommend upgrading past commit     32671e3799ca2e4590773fd0e63aaa4229e50c06.

host has a package installed that is affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the USN-6626-1 advisory.\n\n  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ksmbd, a high-performance in-kernel SMB server. The specific flaw     exists within the processing of SMB2_SESSION_SETUP commands. The issue results from the lack of proper     locking when performing operations on an object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute     code in the context of the kernel. (CVE-2023-32250)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ksmbd, a high-performance in-kernel SMB server. The specific flaw     exists within the handling of SMB2_LOGOFF commands. The issue results from the lack of proper validation     of a pointer prior to accessing it. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-     service condition on the system. (CVE-2023-32252)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ksmbd, a high-performance in-kernel SMB server. The specific flaw     exists within the processing of SMB2_SESSION_SETUP and SMB2_LOGOFF commands. The issue results from the     lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object. An attacker can leverage this     vulnerability to execute code in the context of the kernel. (CVE-2023-32257)\n\n  - Closing of an event channel in the Linux kernel can result in a deadlock. This happens when the close is     being performed in parallel to an unrelated Xen console action and the handling of a Xen console interrupt     in an unprivileged guest. The closing of an event channel is e.g. triggered by removal of a paravirtual     device on the other side. As this action will cause console messages to be issued on the other side quite     often, the chance of triggering the deadlock is not neglectable. Note that 32-bit Arm-guests are not     affected, as the 32-bit Linux kernel on Arm doesn't use queued-RW-locks, which are required to trigger the     issue (on Arm32 a waiting writer doesn't block further readers to get the lock). (CVE-2023-34324)\n\n  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.3.8. A use-after-free was found in ravb_remove in     drivers/net/ethernet/renesas/ravb_main.c. (CVE-2023-35827)\n\n  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.5.9, exploitable by local users with userspace access     to MMIO registers. Incorrect access checking in the #VC handler and instruction emulation of the SEV-ES     emulation of MMIO accesses could lead to arbitrary write access to kernel memory (and thus privilege     escalation). This depends on a race condition through which userspace can replace an instruction before     the #VC handler reads it. (CVE-2023-46813)\n\n  - A use-after-free flaw was found in lan78xx_disconnect in drivers/net/usb/lan78xx.c in the network sub-     component, net/usb/lan78xx in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker to crash the system when     the LAN78XX USB device detaches. (CVE-2023-6039)\n\n  - A null pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel API for the cryptographic algorithm     scatterwalk functionality. This issue occurs when a user constructs a malicious packet with specific     socket configuration, which could allow a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on     the system. (CVE-2023-6176)\n\n  - A null pointer dereference vulnerability was found in nft_dynset_init() in net/netfilter/nft_dynset.c in     nf_tables in the Linux kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN user privilege to     trigger a denial of service. (CVE-2023-6622)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability was found in tipc_crypto_key_revoke in net/tipc/crypto.c in the Linux     kernel's TIPC subsystem. This flaw allows guests with local user privileges to trigger a deadlock and     potentially crash the system.

This results in a potentially exploitable crash.\n    (CVE-2022-3266)\n\n  - When injecting an HTML base element, some requests would ignore the CSP's base-uri settings and accept the     injected element's base instead.  (CVE-2022-40956)\n\n  - Inconsistent data in instruction and data cache when creating wasm code could lead to a potentially     exploitable crash. This bug only affects Firefox on ARM64 platforms.  (CVE-2022-40957)\n\n  - By injecting a cookie with certain special characters, an attacker on a shared subdomain which is not a     secure context could set and thus overwrite cookies from a secure context, leading to session fixation and     other attacks.  (CVE-2022-40958)\n\n  - During iframe navigation, certain pages did not have their FeaturePolicy fully initialized leading to a     bypass that leaked device permissions into untrusted subdocuments.  (CVE-2022-40959)\n\n  - Concurrent use of the URL parser with non-UTF-8 data was not thread-safe. This could lead to a use-after-     free causing a potentially exploitable crash.  (CVE-2022-40960)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Nika Layzell, Timothy Nikkel, Sebastian Hengst, Andreas Pehrson, and the Mozilla     Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 104 and Firefox ESR 102.2. Some of these bugs     showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been     exploited to run arbitrary code.

an out-of-bounds     read and leak memory data into the images created on the canvas element. This vulnerability affects     Firefox < 120, Firefox ESR < 115.5.0, and Thunderbird < 115.5. (CVE-2023-6204)\n\n  - It was possible to cause the use of a MessagePort after it had already been freed, which could potentially     have led to an exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 120, Firefox ESR < 115.5.0, and     Thunderbird < 115.5. (CVE-2023-6205)\n\n  - The black fade animation when exiting fullscreen is roughly the length of the anti-clickjacking delay on     permission prompts. It was possible to use this fact to surprise users by luring them to click where the     permission grant button would be about to appear. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 120, Firefox ESR <     115.5.0, and Thunderbird < 115.5. (CVE-2023-6206)\n\n  - Ownership mismanagement led to a use-after-free in ReadableByteStreams This vulnerability affects Firefox     < 120, Firefox ESR < 115.5.0, and Thunderbird < 115.5. (CVE-2023-6207)\n\n  - When using X11, text selected by the page using the Selection API was erroneously copied into the primary     selection, a temporary storage not unlike the clipboard. *This bug only affects Firefox on X11. Other     systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 120, Firefox ESR < 115.5.0, and Thunderbird     < 115.5. (CVE-2023-6208)\n\n  - Relative URLs starting with three slashes were incorrectly parsed, and a path-traversal /../ part in the     path could be used to override the specified host. This could contribute to security problems in web     sites. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 120, Firefox ESR < 115.5.0, and Thunderbird < 115.5.\n    (CVE-2023-6209)\n\n  - When an https: web page created a pop-up from a javascript: URL, that pop-up was incorrectly allowed to     load blockable content such as iframes from insecure http: URLs This vulnerability affects Firefox < 120.\n    (CVE-2023-6210)\n\n  - If an attacker needed a user to load an insecure http: page and knew that user had enabled HTTPS-only     mode, the attacker could have tricked the user into clicking to grant an HTTPS-only exception if they     could get the user to participate in a clicking game. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 120.\n    (CVE-2023-6211)\n\n  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 119, Firefox ESR 115.4, and Thunderbird 115.4. Some of these bugs     showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been     exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 120, Firefox ESR < 115.5.0, and     Thunderbird < 115.5. (CVE-2023-6212)\n\n  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 119. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we     presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

A cleartext transmission of sensitive information vulnerability exists in curl <v7.88.0 that could cause     HSTS functionality fail when multiple URLs are requested serially. Using its HSTS support, curl can be     instructed to use HTTPS instead of usingan insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the     URL.

Using its HSTS     support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when     HTTP is provided in the URL. This HSTS mechanism would however surprisingly fail when multiple transfers     are done in parallel as the HSTS cache file gets overwritten by the most recentlycompleted transfer. A     later HTTP-only transfer to the earlier host name would then *not* get upgraded properly to HSTS.\n    (CVE-2023-23915)\n\n  - An allocation of resources without limits or throttling vulnerability exists in curl <v7.88.0 based on the     chained HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a server response can be compressed multiple times and     potentially with differentalgorithms. The number of acceptable links in this decompression chain     wascapped, but the cap was implemented on a per-header basis allowing a maliciousserver to insert a     virtually unlimited number of compression steps simply byusing many headers. The use of such a     decompression chain could result in a malloc bomb, making curl end up spending enormous amounts of     allocated heap memory, or trying to and returning out of memory errors.

host has a package installed that is affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the USN-6172-1 advisory.\n\n  - A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. The tun/tap sockets have their socket UID hardcoded to 0 due to a     type confusion in their initialization function. While it will be often correct, as tuntap devices require     CAP_NET_ADMIN, it may not always be the case, e.g., a non-root user only having that capability. This     would make tun/tap sockets being incorrectly treated in filtering/routing decisions, possibly bypassing     network filters. (CVE-2023-1076)\n\n  - In the Linux kernel, pick_next_rt_entity() may return a type confused entry, not detected by the BUG_ON     condition, as the confused entry will not be NULL, but list_head.The buggy error condition would lead to a     type confused entry with the list head,which would then be used as a type confused sched_rt_entity,causing     memory corruption. (CVE-2023-1077)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free may be triggered in asus_kbd_backlight_set when     plugging/disconnecting in a malicious USB device, which advertises itself as an Asus device. Similarly to     the previous known CVE-2023-25012, but in asus devices, the work_struct may be scheduled by the LED     controller while the device is disconnecting, triggering a use-after-free on the struct asus_kbd_leds *led     structure. A malicious USB device may exploit the issue to cause memory corruption with controlled data.\n    (CVE-2023-1079)\n\n  - A flaw use after free in the Linux kernel Xircom 16-bit PCMCIA (PC-card) Ethernet driver was found.A local     user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n    (CVE-2023-1670)\n\n  - A use-after-free flaw was found in xen_9pfs_front_removet in net/9p/trans_xen.c in Xen transport for 9pfs     in the Linux Kernel. This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a race problem,     possibly leading to a kernel information leak. (CVE-2023-1859)\n\n  - The Linux kernel allows userspace processes to enable mitigations by calling prctl with     PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL which disables the speculation feature as well as by using seccomp. We had noticed     that on VMs of at least one major cloud provider, the kernel still left the victim process exposed to     attacks in some cases even after enabling the spectre-BTI mitigation with prctl. The same behavior can be     observed on a bare-metal machine when forcing the mitigation to IBRS on boot command line. This happened     because when plain IBRS was enabled (not enhanced IBRS), the kernel had some logic that determined that     STIBP was not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly protects against cross-thread branch target injection.\n    However, with legacy IBRS, the IBRS bit was cleared on returning to userspace, due to performance reasons,     which disabled the implicit STIBP and left userspace threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target     injection against which STIBP protects. (CVE-2023-1998)\n\n  - The Linux kernel through 6.1.9 has a Use-After-Free in bigben_remove in drivers/hid/hid-bigbenff.c via a     crafted USB device because the LED controllers remain registered for too long. (CVE-2023-25012)\n\n  - A use after free flaw was found in hfsplus_put_super in fs/hfsplus/super.c in the Linux Kernel. This flaw     could allow a local user to cause a denial of service problem. (CVE-2023-2985)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.","exploit_available":true,"exploit_framework_canvas":false,"exploit_framework_core":false,"exploit_framework_d2_elliot":false,"exploit_framework_exploithub":false,"exploit_framework_metasploit":false,"exploitability_ease":"Exploits are available","exploited_by_malware":false,"exploited_by_nessus":false,"family":"Ubuntu Local Security Checks","family_id":58,"has_patch":true,"id":183722,"in_the_news":false,"name":"Ubuntu 20.04 LTS / 22.04 LTS : Linux kernel vulnerabilities (USN-6172-1)","patch_publication_date":"2023-06-16T00:00:00Z","modification_date":"2024-01-09T00:00:00Z","publication_date":"2023-10-23T00:00:00Z","risk_factor":"high","see_also":["https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6172-1"],"solution":"Update the affected kernel package.","synopsis":"The remote Ubuntu host is missing one or more security updates.","unsupported_by_vendor":false,"usn":"6172-1","version":"1.1","vuln_publication_date":"2023-02-02T00:00:00Z","xrefs":[{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-1076"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-1077"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-1079"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-1670"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-1859"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-1998"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-25012"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-2985"},{"type":"USN","id":"6172-1"}],"vpr":{"score":6.7,"drivers":{"age_of_vuln":{"lower_bound":181,"upper_bound":365},"exploit_code_maturity":"UNPROVEN","cvss_impact_score_predicted":false,"cvss3_impact_score":5.9,"threat_intensity_last28":"VERY_LOW","threat_sources_last28":["No recorded events"],"product_coverage":"LOW"},"updated":"2023-09-25T06:02:17Z"},"cve":["CVE-2023-1076","CVE-2023-1077","CVE-2023-1079","CVE-2023-1670","CVE-2023-1859","CVE-2023-1998","CVE-2023-25012","CVE-2023-2985"],"type":"local"},"port":{"port":0,"protocol":"TCP"},"scan":{"schedule_uuid":"template-dc6873ce-017a-0f45-e33f-82a067333cc80975a6cd4824e898","started_at":"2024-03-11T00:13:15Z","uuid":"6f80368c-99c3-73e3-611d-1a70529f1043"},"severity":"high","severity_id":3,"severity_default_id":3,"severity_modification_type":"NONE","first_found":"2023-10-27T18:41:18Z","last_found":"2024-03-11T01:52:21Z","state":"OPEN","indexed":"2024-03-11T02:03:25.698314Z","source":"AGENT"},{"asset":{"agent_uuid":"3750d349904a47d6aef0ef561b8b5f77","bios_uuid":"ec2758b4-b5f3-0bb2-f908-7649584bf9fa","device_type":"aws-ec2-instance","fqdn":"ip-172-20-0-1.us-east-2.compute.internal","hostname":"trh-agent","uuid":"5fcc163c-ce62-4abc-b655-5bab9ae23bf9","ipv4":"172.20.0.1","ipv6":"fe80::1","last_authenticated_results":"2024-03-11T01:52:21Z","mac_address":"02:42:45:f7:52:4a","operating_system":["Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS (Focal Fossa)"],"network_id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","tracked":true,"assetTags":[{"uuid":"e7cd429e-7660-4f1b-8c58-ffab0fedc01c","key":"testv","value":"123","added_by":"67368e82-4fe4-4447-ba6f-ea1f7120c52c","added_at":"2023-10-06T13:07:56.676Z"}]},"output":"\n  Path              : /opt/tomcat\n  Installed version : 9.0.71\n  Fixed version     : 9.0.74\n","plugin":{"bid":[176278],"checks_for_default_account":false,"checks_for_malware":false,"cpe":["cpe:/a:apache:tomcat"],"cvss3_base_score":7.5,"cvss3_temporal_score":6.5,"cvss3_temporal_vector":{"exploitability":"Unproven","remediation_level":"Official Fix","report_confidence":"Confirmed","raw":"E:U/RL:O/RC:C"},"cvss3_vector":{"access_complexity":"Low","access_vector":"Network","availability_impact":"High","confidentiality_impact":"None","integrity_impact":"None","raw":"AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"cvss_base_score":7.8,"cvss_temporal_score":5.8,"cvss_temporal_vector":{"exploitability":"Unproven","remediation_level":"Official Fix","report_confidence":"Confirmed","raw":"E:U/RL:OF/RC:C"},"cvss_vector":{"access_complexity":"Low","access_vector":"Network","authentication":"None required","availability_impact":"Complete","confidentiality_impact":"None","integrity_impact":"None","raw":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C"},"description":"The version of Tomcat installed on the remote host is prior to 9.0.74.

potentially be exploited.\n    (CVE-2022-46871)\n\n  - An attacker who compromised a content process could have partially escaped the sandbox to read arbitrary     files via clipboard-related IPC messages. This bug only affects Thunderbird for Linux. Other operating     systems are unaffected.  (CVE-2022-46872)\n\n  - Because Firefox did not implement the <code>unsafe-hashes</code> CSP directive, an attacker who was able     to inject markup into a page otherwise protected by a Content Security Policy may have been able to inject     executable script.  This would be severely constrained by the specified Content Security Policy of the     document.  (CVE-2022-46873)\n\n  - A file with a long filename could have had its filename truncated to remove the valid extension, leaving a     malicious extension in its place. This could potentially led to user confusion and the execution of     malicious code.  (CVE-2022-46874)\n\n  - By confusing the browser, the fullscreen notification could have been delayed or suppressed, resulting in     potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.  (CVE-2022-46877)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Valentin Gosu, Olli Pettay, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory     safety bugs present in Firefox 107 and Firefox ESR 102.5.

The issue involves how the urlparse method does not     sanitize input and allows characters like '\\r' and '\\n' in the URL path. This flaw allows an attacker to     input a crafted URL, leading to injection attacks. This flaw affects Python versions prior to 3.10.0b1,     3.9.5, 3.8.11, 3.7.11 and 3.6.14.

packages installed that are affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the USN-6562-1 advisory.\n\n  - The WebGL `DrawElementsInstanced` method was susceptible to a heap buffer overflow when used on systems     with the Mesa VM driver. This issue could allow an attacker to perform remote code execution and sandbox     escape. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox < 121.\n    (CVE-2023-6856)\n\n  - Multiple NSS NIST curves were susceptible to a side-channel attack known as Minerva. This attack could     potentially allow an attacker to recover the private key. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121.\n    (CVE-2023-6135)\n\n  - `EncryptingOutputStream` was susceptible to exposing uninitialized data. This issue could only be abused     in order to write data to a local disk which may have implications for private browsing mode. This     vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6 and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6865)\n\n  - When resolving a symlink, a race may occur where the buffer passed to `readlink` may actually be smaller     than necessary. *This bug only affects Firefox on Unix-based operating systems (Android, Linux, MacOS).\n    Windows is unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox <     121. (CVE-2023-6857)\n\n  - Firefox was susceptible to a heap buffer overflow in `nsTextFragment` due to insufficient OOM handling.\n    This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6858)\n\n  - A use-after-free condition affected TLS socket creation when under memory pressure. This vulnerability     affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6859)\n\n  - TypedArrays can be fallible and lacked proper exception handling. This could lead to abuse in other APIs     which expect TypedArrays to always succeed. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6866)\n\n  - The `VideoBridge` allowed any content process to use textures produced by remote decoders. This could be     abused to escape the sandbox. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and     Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6860)\n\n  - The timing of a button click causing a popup to disappear was approximately the same length as the anti-     clickjacking delay on permission prompts. It was possible to use this fact to surprise users by luring     them to click where the permission grant button would be about to appear. This vulnerability affects     Firefox ESR < 115.6 and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6867)\n\n  - The `nsWindow::PickerOpen(void)` method was susceptible to a heap buffer overflow when running in headless     mode. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox < 121.\n    (CVE-2023-6861)\n\n  - A `<dialog>` element could have been manipulated to paint content outside of a sandboxed iframe. This     could allow untrusted content to display under the guise of trusted content. This vulnerability affects     Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6869)\n\n  - Under certain conditions, Firefox did not display a warning when a user attempted to navigate to a new     protocol handler. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6871)\n\n  - Browser tab titles were being leaked by GNOME to system logs. This could potentially expose the browsing     habits of users running in a private tab.

OpenPrinting CUPS is a standards-based, open source printing system for Linux and other Unix-like     operating systems. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.4.6, CUPS logs data of free memory to     the logging service AFTER the connection has been closed, when it should have logged the data right     before. This is a use-after-free bug that impacts the entire cupsd process. The exact cause of this issue     is the function `httpClose(con->http)` being called in `scheduler/client.c`. The problem is that httpClose     always, provided its argument is not null, frees the pointer at the end of the call, only for     cupsdLogClient to pass the pointer to httpGetHostname. This issue happens in function `cupsdAcceptClient`     if LogLevel is warn or higher and in two scenarios: there is a double-lookup for the IP Address     (HostNameLookups Double is set in `cupsd.conf`) which fails to resolve, or if CUPS is compiled with TCP     wrappers and the connection is refused by rules from `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny`. Version     2.4.6 has a patch for this issue.

BIND 9 resolver can crash when stale cache and stale answers are enabled, option `stale-answer-client-     timeout` is set to a positive integer, and the resolver receives an RRSIG query. This issue affects BIND 9     versions 9.16.12 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through 9.18.10, 9.19.0 through 9.19.8, and 9.16.12-S1 through     9.16.36-S1. (CVE-2022-3736)\n\n  - Sending a flood of dynamic DNS updates may cause `named` to allocate large amounts of memory. This, in     turn, may cause `named` to exit due to a lack of free memory. We are not aware of any cases where this has     been exploited. Memory is allocated prior to the checking of access permissions (ACLs) and is retained     during the processing of a dynamic update from a client whose access credentials are accepted. Memory     allocated to clients that are not permitted to send updates is released immediately upon rejection. The     scope of this vulnerability is limited therefore to trusted clients who are permitted to make dynamic zone     changes. If a dynamic update is REFUSED, memory will be released again very quickly. Therefore it is only     likely to be possible to degrade or stop `named` by sending a flood of unaccepted dynamic updates     comparable in magnitude to a query flood intended to achieve the same detrimental outcome. BIND 9.11 and     earlier branches are also affected, but through exhaustion of internal resources rather than memory     constraints. This may reduce performance but should not be a significant problem for most servers.\n    Therefore we don't intend to address this for BIND versions prior to BIND 9.16. This issue affects BIND 9     versions 9.16.0 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through 9.18.10, 9.19.0 through 9.19.8, and 9.16.8-S1 through     9.16.36-S1. (CVE-2022-3094)\n\n  - This issue can affect BIND 9 resolvers with `stale-answer-enable yes;` that also make use of the option     `stale-answer-client-timeout`, configured with a value greater than zero. If the resolver receives many     queries that require recursion, there will be a corresponding increase in the number of clients that are     waiting for recursion to complete. If there are sufficient clients already waiting when a new client query     is received so that it is necessary to SERVFAIL the longest waiting client (see BIND 9 ARM `recursive-     clients` limit and soft quota), then it is possible for a race to occur between providing a stale answer     to this older client and sending an early timeout SERVFAIL, which may cause an assertion failure. This     issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.12 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through 9.18.10, 9.19.0 through 9.19.8, and     9.16.12-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.

host has packages installed that are affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the USN-5880-1 advisory.\n\n  - An attacker could construct a PKCS 12 cert bundle in such a way that could allow for arbitrary memory     writes via PKCS 12 Safe Bag attributes being mishandled.  (CVE-2023-0767)\n\n  - The <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> header could allow an attacker to leak a child     iframe's unredacted URI when interaction with that iframe triggers a redirect.  (CVE-2023-25728)\n\n  - Permission prompts for opening external schemes were only shown for <code>ContentPrincipals</code>     resulting in extensions being able to open them without user interaction via     <code>ExpandedPrincipals</code>. This could lead to further malicious actions such as downloading files or     interacting with software already installed on the system.  (CVE-2023-25729)\n\n  - A background script invoking <code>requestFullscreen</code> and then blocking the main thread could force     the browser into fullscreen mode indefinitely, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.\n    (CVE-2023-25730)\n\n  - Due to URL previews in the network panel of developer tools improperly storing URLs, query parameters     could potentially be used to overwrite global objects in privileged code.  (CVE-2023-25731)\n\n  - When encoding data from an <code>inputStream</code> in <code>xpcom</code> the size of the input being     encoded was not correctly calculated potentially leading to an out of bounds memory write.\n    (CVE-2023-25732)\n\n  - The return value from <code>gfx::SourceSurfaceSkia::Map()</code> wasn't being verified which could have     potentially lead to a null pointer dereference.  (CVE-2023-25733)\n\n  - Cross-compartment wrappers wrapping a scripted proxy could have caused objects from other compartments to     be stored in the main compartment resulting in a use-after-free after unwrapping the proxy.\n    (CVE-2023-25735)\n\n  - An invalid downcast from <code>nsHTMLDocument</code> to <code>nsIContent</code> could have lead to     undefined behavior.  (CVE-2023-25736)\n\n  - An invalid downcast from <code>nsTextNode</code> to <code>SVGElement</code> could have lead to undefined     behavior.  (CVE-2023-25737)\n\n  - Module load requests that failed were not being checked as to whether or not they were cancelled causing a     use-after-free in <code>ScriptLoadContext</code>.  (CVE-2023-25739)\n\n  - When dragging and dropping an image cross-origin, the image's size could potentially be leaked. This     behavior was shipped in 109 and caused web compatibility problems as well as this security concern, so the     behavior was disabled until further review.  (CVE-2023-25741)\n\n  - When importing a SPKI RSA public key as ECDSA P-256, the key would be handled incorrectly causing the tab     to crash.  (CVE-2023-25742)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Kershaw Chang and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in     Firefox 109 and Firefox ESR 102.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume     that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.  (CVE-2023-25744)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Timothy Nikkel, Gabriele Svelto, Jeff Muizelaar and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported     memory safety bugs present in Firefox 109. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we     presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.\n    (CVE-2023-25745)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.","exploit_available":true,"exploit_framework_canvas":false,"exploit_framework_core":false,"exploit_framework_d2_elliot":false,"exploit_framework_exploithub":false,"exploit_framework_metasploit":false,"exploitability_ease":"Exploits are available","exploited_by_malware":false,"exploited_by_nessus":false,"family":"Ubuntu Local Security Checks","family_id":58,"has_patch":true,"id":171637,"in_the_news":false,"name":"Ubuntu 18.04 LTS / 20.04 LTS : Firefox vulnerabilities (USN-5880-1)","patch_publication_date":"2023-02-20T00:00:00Z","modification_date":"2023-10-16T00:00:00Z","publication_date":"2023-02-20T00:00:00Z","risk_factor":"critical","see_also":["https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5880-1"],"solution":"Update the affected packages.","stig_severity":"I","synopsis":"The remote Ubuntu host is missing one or more security updates.","unsupported_by_vendor":false,"usn":"5880-1","version":"1.3","vuln_publication_date":"2023-02-14T00:00:00Z","xrefs":[{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-0767"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-25728"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-25729"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-25730"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-25731"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-25732"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-25733"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-25735"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-25736"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-25737"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-25739"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-25741"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-25742"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-25744"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-25745"},{"type":"IAVA","id":"2023-A-0081-S"},{"type":"USN","id":"5880-1"}],"vpr":{"score":6.7,"drivers":{"age_of_vuln":{"lower_bound":181,"upper_bound":365},"exploit_code_maturity":"UNPROVEN","cvss_impact_score_predicted":false,"cvss3_impact_score":5.9,"threat_intensity_last28":"VERY_LOW","threat_sources_last28":["No recorded events"],"product_coverage":"LOW"},"updated":"2023-11-30T06:03:20Z"},"cve":["CVE-2023-0767","CVE-2023-25728","CVE-2023-25729","CVE-2023-25730","CVE-2023-25731","CVE-2023-25732","CVE-2023-25733","CVE-2023-25735","CVE-2023-25736","CVE-2023-25737","CVE-2023-25739","CVE-2023-25741","CVE-2023-25742","CVE-2023-25744","CVE-2023-25745"],"type":"local"},"port":{"port":0,"protocol":"TCP"},"scan":{"schedule_uuid":"template-dc6873ce-017a-0f45-e33f-82a067333cc80975a6cd4824e898","started_at":"2024-03-11T00:13:15Z","uuid":"6f80368c-99c3-73e3-611d-1a70529f1043"},"severity":"critical","severity_id":4,"severity_default_id":4,"severity_modification_type":"NONE","first_found":"2023-09-18T19:51:48Z","last_found":"2024-03-11T01:52:21Z","state":"OPEN","indexed":"2024-03-11T02:03:20.328068Z","source":"AGENT"},{"asset":{"agent_uuid":"3750d349904a47d6aef0ef561b8b5f77","bios_uuid":"ec2758b4-b5f3-0bb2-f908-7649584bf9fa","device_type":"aws-ec2-instance","fqdn":"ip-172-20-0-1.us-east-2.compute.internal","hostname":"trh-agent","uuid":"5fcc163c-ce62-4abc-b655-5bab9ae23bf9","ipv4":"172.20.0.1","ipv6":"fe80::1","last_authenticated_results":"2024-03-11T01:52:21Z","mac_address":"02:42:45:f7:52:4a","operating_system":["Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS (Focal Fossa)"],"network_id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","tracked":true,"assetTags":[{"uuid":"e7cd429e-7660-4f1b-8c58-ffab0fedc01c","key":"testv","value":"123","added_by":"67368e82-4fe4-4447-ba6f-ea1f7120c52c","added_at":"2023-10-06T13:07:56.676Z"}]},"output":"\n  -

curl before 7.86.0 has a double free. If curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a non-     HTTP(S) URL, it sets up the connection to the remote server by issuing a CONNECT request to the proxy, and     then tunnels the rest of the protocol through. An HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP proxies often     only allow outgoing connections to specific port numbers, like 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non-200     status code to the client. Due to flaws in the error/cleanup handling, this could trigger a double free in     curl if one of the following schemes were used in the URL for the transfer: dict, gopher, gophers, ldap,     ldaps, rtmp, rtmps, or telnet. The earliest affected version is 7.77.0. (CVE-2022-42915)\n\n  - When doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to     ask for data to send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle     previously was used to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the     application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or     similar in the subsequent `POST` request. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is     changed from a PUT to a POST. (CVE-2022-32221)\n\n  - curl can be told to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that file endsin a line with 4095     consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curlwould first read past the end of the stack-based     buffer, and if the readworks, write a zero byte beyond its boundary.This will in most cases cause a     segfault or similar, but circumstances might also cause different outcomes.If a malicious user can provide     a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents, this flaw could be used as denial-     of-service. (CVE-2022-35260)\n\n  - In curl before 7.86.0, the HSTS check could be bypassed to trick it into staying with HTTP. Using its HSTS     support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS directly (instead of using an insecure cleartext HTTP step)     even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This mechanism could be bypassed if the host name in the given URL     uses IDN characters that get replaced with ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN conversion, e.g., using     the character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common ASCII full stop of U+002E (.).\n    The earliest affected version is 7.77.0 2021-05-26.

Some mod_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request     Smuggling attack. Configurations are affected when mod_proxy is enabled along with some form of     RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches some portion of the user-supplied     request-target (URL) data and is then re-inserted into the proxied request-target using variable     substitution. For example, something like: RewriteEngine on RewriteRule ^/here/(.*)     http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1; [P] ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/ Request     splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended     URLs to existing origin servers, and cache poisoning.

When performing a local clone (where the source and target of the clone are on the same     volume), Git copies the contents of the source's `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory into the destination by     either creating hardlinks to the source contents, or copying them (if hardlinks are disabled via `--no-     hardlinks`). A malicious actor could convince a victim to clone a repository with a symbolic link pointing     at sensitive information on the victim's machine. This can be done either by having the victim clone a     malicious repository on the same machine, or having them clone a malicious repository embedded as a bare     repository via a submodule from any source, provided they clone with the `--recurse-submodules` option.\n    Git does not create symbolic links in the `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory. The problem has been patched in     the versions published on 2022-10-18, and backported to v2.30.x. Potential workarounds: Avoid cloning     untrusted repositories using the `--local` optimization when on a shared machine, either by passing the     `--no-local` option to `git clone` or cloning from a URL that uses the `file://` scheme. Alternatively,     avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules` or run `git config --global     protocol.file.allow user`. (CVE-2022-39253)\n\n  - Git is an open source, scalable, distributed revision control system. `git shell` is a restricted login     shell that can be used to implement Git's push/pull functionality via SSH. In versions prior to 2.30.6,     2.31.5, 2.32.4, 2.33.5, 2.34.5, 2.35.5, 2.36.3, and 2.37.4, the function that splits the command arguments     into an array improperly uses an `int` to represent the number of entries in the array, allowing a     malicious actor to intentionally overflow the return value, leading to arbitrary heap writes. Because the     resulting array is then passed to `execv()`, it is possible to leverage this attack to gain remote code     execution on a victim machine. Note that a victim must first allow access to `git shell` as a login shell     in order to be vulnerable to this attack. This problem is patched in versions 2.30.6, 2.31.5, 2.32.4,     2.33.5, 2.34.5, 2.35.5, 2.36.3, and 2.37.4 and users are advised to upgrade to the latest version.\n    Disabling `git shell` access via remote logins is a viable short-term workaround.

Unfortunately the logic introduced there     didn't account for the extreme case of the entire packet being split into as many pieces as permitted by     the protocol, yet still being smaller than the area that's specially dealt with to keep all (possible)     headers together. Such an unusual packet would therefore trigger a buffer overrun in the driver.\n    (CVE-2023-34319)\n\n  - A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to     achieve local privilege escalation. Due to a race condition between nf_tables netlink control plane     transaction and nft_set element garbage collection, it is possible to underflow the reference counter     causing a use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading past commit     3e91b0ebd994635df2346353322ac51ce84ce6d8. (CVE-2023-4244)\n\n  - An integer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel. This issue leads to the kernel allocating     `skb_shared_info` in the userspace, which is exploitable in systems without SMAP protection since     `skb_shared_info` contains references to function pointers. (CVE-2023-42752)\n\n  - An array indexing vulnerability was found in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel. A missing macro     could lead to a miscalculation of the `h->nets` array offset, providing attackers with the primitive to     arbitrarily increment/decrement a memory buffer out-of-bound. This issue may allow a local user to crash     the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2023-42753)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the IPv4 Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) classifier in the Linux kernel. The xprt     pointer may go beyond the linear part of the skb, leading to an out-of-bounds read in the `rsvp_classify`     function. This issue may allow a local user to crash the system and cause a denial of service.\n    (CVE-2023-42755)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel. A race condition between IPSET_CMD_ADD     and IPSET_CMD_SWAP can lead to a kernel panic due to the invocation of `__ip_set_put` on a wrong `set`.\n    This issue may allow a local user to crash the system. (CVE-2023-42756)\n\n  - A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's af_unix component can be exploited to achieve local     privilege escalation. The unix_stream_sendpage() function tries to add data to the last skb in the peer's     recv queue without locking the queue. Thus there is a race where unix_stream_sendpage() could access an     skb locklessly that is being released by garbage collection, resulting in use-after-free. We recommend     upgrading past commit 790c2f9d15b594350ae9bca7b236f2b1859de02c. (CVE-2023-4622)\n\n  - A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_hfsc (HFSC qdisc traffic control)     component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. If a class with a link-sharing curve     (i.e. with the HFSC_FSC flag set) has a parent without a link-sharing curve, then init_vf() will call     vttree_insert() on the parent, but vttree_remove() will be skipped in update_vf(). This leaves a dangling     pointer that can cause a use-after-free. We recommend upgrading past commit     b3d26c5702c7d6c45456326e56d2ccf3f103e60f. (CVE-2023-4623)\n\n  - Rejected reason: CVE-2023-4881 was wrongly assigned to a bug that was deemed to be a non-security issue by     the Linux kernel security team. (CVE-2023-4881)\n\n  - A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_qfq component can be exploited to     achieve local privilege escalation. When the plug qdisc is used as a class of the qfq qdisc, sending     network packets triggers use-after-free in qfq_dequeue() due to the incorrect .peek handler of sch_plug     and lack of error checking in agg_dequeue(). We recommend upgrading past commit     8fc134fee27f2263988ae38920bc03da416b03d8. (CVE-2023-4921)\n\n  - A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to     achieve local privilege escalation. Addition and removal of rules from chain bindings within the same     transaction causes leads to use-after-free. We recommend upgrading past commit     f15f29fd4779be8a418b66e9d52979bb6d6c2325.

remote Ubuntu 20.04 LTS / 22.04 LTS host has a package installed that is affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the USN-5912-1 advisory.\n\n  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A denial of service flaw may occur if there is a consecutive request     of the NVME_IOCTL_RESET and the NVME_IOCTL_SUBSYS_RESET through the device file of the driver, resulting     in a PCIe link disconnect. (CVE-2022-3169)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD nested virtualization (SVM). A malicious L1 guest could purposely fail     to intercept the shutdown of a cooperative nested guest (L2), possibly leading to a page fault and kernel     panic in the host (L0). (CVE-2022-3344)\n\n  - A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in Linux Kernel. This affects the function     fib_nh_match of the file net/ipv4/fib_semantics.c of the component IPv4 Handler. The manipulation leads to     out-of-bounds read. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to     fix this issue. The identifier VDB-210357 was assigned to this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3435)\n\n  - A vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects     the function kcm_tx_work of the file net/kcm/kcmsock.c of the component kcm. The manipulation leads to     race condition. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211018 is the identifier     assigned to this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3521)\n\n  - A vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability     is the function area_cache_get of the file drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/nfpcore/nfp_cppcore.c of the     component IPsec. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this     issue. The identifier VDB-211045 was assigned to this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3545)\n\n  - An incorrect TLB flush issue was found in the Linux kernel's GPU i915 kernel driver, potentially leading     to random memory corruption or data leaks. This flaw could allow a local user to crash the system or     escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-4139)\n\n  - Guests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs;\n    the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] The patch for XSA-392 introduced     another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the     XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328). Additionally when dropping packages for other reasons the same deadlock     could occur in case of netpoll being active for the interface the xen-netback driver is connected to     (CVE-2022-42329). (CVE-2022-42328, CVE-2022-42329)\n\n  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in __nfs42_ssc_open() in fs/nfs/nfs4file.c in the Linux kernel.\n    This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a remote denial (CVE-2022-4379)\n\n  - A race condition in the x86 KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel through 6.1-rc6 allows guest OS users to     cause a denial of service (host OS crash or host OS memory corruption) when nested virtualisation and the     TDP MMU are enabled. (CVE-2022-45869)\n\n  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.0.11. Missing validation of the number of channels in     drivers/net/wireless/microchip/wilc1000/cfg80211.c in the WILC1000 wireless driver can trigger a heap-     based buffer overflow when copying the list of operating channels from Wi-Fi management frames.\n    (CVE-2022-47518)\n\n  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.0.11. Missing validation of     IEEE80211_P2P_ATTR_OPER_CHANNEL in drivers/net/wireless/microchip/wilc1000/cfg80211.c in the WILC1000     wireless driver can trigger an out-of-bounds write when parsing the channel list attribute from Wi-Fi     management frames. (CVE-2022-47519)\n\n  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.0.11. Missing offset validation in     drivers/net/wireless/microchip/wilc1000/hif.c in the WILC1000 wireless driver can trigger an out-of-bounds     read when parsing a Robust Security Network (RSN) information element from a Netlink packet.\n    (CVE-2022-47520)\n\n  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.0.11. Missing validation of     IEEE80211_P2P_ATTR_CHANNEL_LIST in drivers/net/wireless/microchip/wilc1000/cfg80211.c in the WILC1000     wireless driver can trigger a heap-based buffer overflow when parsing the operating channel attribute from     Wi-Fi management frames. (CVE-2022-47521)\n\n  - A buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux Kernel. This issue could     allow the leakage of both stack and heap addresses, and potentially allow Local Privilege Escalation to     the root user via arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2023-0179)\n\n  - There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel which can be exploited to achieve local     privilege escalation. To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLS or     CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP has to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege. There is a     use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_data of a struct inet_connection_sock. When CONFIG_TLS is enabled, user can     install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this     socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the context     is inherited and vulnerable. The setsockopt TCP_ULP operation does not require any privilege. We recommend     upgrading past commit 2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c (CVE-2023-0461)\n\n  - A use-after-free flaw was found in io_uring/poll.c in io_poll_check_events in the io_uring subcomponent in     the Linux Kernel due to a race condition of poll_refs. This flaw may cause a NULL pointer dereference.\n    (CVE-2023-0468)\n\n  - In the Linux kernel 6.0.8, there is a use-after-free in inode_cgwb_move_to_attached in fs/fs-writeback.c,     related to __list_del_entry_valid. (CVE-2023-26605)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.","exploit_available":true,"exploit_framework_canvas":false,"exploit_framework_core":false,"exploit_framework_d2_elliot":false,"exploit_framework_exploithub":false,"exploit_framework_metasploit":false,"exploitability_ease":"Exploits are available","exploited_by_malware":false,"exploited_by_nessus":false,"family":"Ubuntu Local Security Checks","family_id":58,"has_patch":true,"id":172136,"in_the_news":false,"name":"Ubuntu 20.04 LTS / 22.04 LTS : Linux kernel vulnerabilities (USN-5912-1)","patch_publication_date":"2023-03-02T00:00:00Z","modification_date":"2024-01-09T00:00:00Z","publication_date":"2023-03-06T00:00:00Z","risk_factor":"medium","see_also":["https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5912-1"],"solution":"Update the affected kernel package.","synopsis":"The remote Ubuntu host is missing one or more security updates.","unsupported_by_vendor":false,"usn":"5912-1","version":"1.3","vuln_publication_date":"2022-09-09T00:00:00Z","xrefs":[{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-3169"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-3344"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-3435"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-3521"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-3545"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-4139"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-42328"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-42329"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-4379"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-45869"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-47518"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-47519"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-47520"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-47521"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-0179"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-0461"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-0468"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-26605"},{"type":"USN","id":"5912-1"}],"vpr":{"score":8.4,"drivers":{"age_of_vuln":{"lower_bound":366,"upper_bound":730},"exploit_code_maturity":"UNPROVEN","cvss_impact_score_predicted":false,"cvss3_impact_score":5.9,"threat_intensity_last28":"MEDIUM","threat_recency":{"lower_bound":8,"upper_bound":30},"threat_sources_last28":["Social Media"],"product_coverage":"LOW"},"updated":"2024-02-29T06:01:44Z"},"cve":["CVE-2022-3169","CVE-2022-3344","CVE-2022-3435","CVE-2022-3521","CVE-2022-3545","CVE-2022-4139","CVE-2022-42328","CVE-2022-42329","CVE-2022-4379","CVE-2022-45869","CVE-2022-47518","CVE-2022-47519","CVE-2022-47520","CVE-2022-47521","CVE-2023-0179","CVE-2023-0461","CVE-2023-0468","CVE-2023-26605"],"type":"local"},"port":{"port":0,"protocol":"TCP"},"scan":{"schedule_uuid":"template-dc6873ce-017a-0f45-e33f-82a067333cc80975a6cd4824e898","started_at":"2024-03-11T00:13:15Z","uuid":"6f80368c-99c3-73e3-611d-1a70529f1043"},"severity":"high","severity_id":3,"severity_default_id":2,"severity_modification_type":"NONE","first_found":"2023-09-18T19:51:48Z","last_found":"2024-03-11T01:52:21Z","state":"OPEN","indexed":"2024-03-11T02:03:24.406971Z","source":"AGENT"},{"asset":{"agent_uuid":"3750d349904a47d6aef0ef561b8b5f77","bios_uuid":"ec2758b4-b5f3-0bb2-f908-7649584bf9fa","device_type":"aws-ec2-instance","fqdn":"ip-172-20-0-1.us-east-2.compute.internal","hostname":"trh-agent","uuid":"5fcc163c-ce62-4abc-b655-5bab9ae23bf9","ipv4":"172.20.0.1","ipv6":"fe80::1","last_authenticated_results":"2024-03-11T01:52:21Z","mac_address":"02:42:45:f7:52:4a","operating_system":["Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS (Focal Fossa)"],"network_id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","tracked":true,"assetTags":[{"uuid":"e7cd429e-7660-4f1b-8c58-ffab0fedc01c","key":"testv","value":"123","added_by":"67368e82-4fe4-4447-ba6f-ea1f7120c52c","added_at":"2023-10-06T13:07:56.676Z"}]},"output":"\n  -

Git is a revision control system. Using a specially-crafted repository, Git prior to versions 2.39.2,     2.38.4, 2.37.6, 2.36.5, 2.35.7, 2.34.7, 2.33.7, 2.32.6, 2.31.7, and 2.30.8 can be tricked into using its     local clone optimization even when using a non-local transport. Though Git will abort local clones whose     source `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory contains symbolic links, the `objects` directory itself may still be a     symbolic link. These two may be combined to include arbitrary files based on known paths on the victim's     filesystem within the malicious repository's working copy, allowing for data exfiltration in a similar     manner as CVE-2022-39253. A fix has been prepared and will appear in v2.39.2 v2.38.4 v2.37.6 v2.36.5     v2.35.7 v2.34.7 v2.33.7 v2.32.6, v2.31.7 and v2.30.8. If upgrading is impractical, two short-term     workarounds are available. Avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules`.\n    Instead, consider cloning repositories without recursively cloning their submodules, and instead run `git     submodule update` at each layer. Before doing so, inspect each new `.gitmodules` file to ensure that it     does not contain suspicious module URLs. (CVE-2023-22490)\n\n  - Git, a revision control system, is vulnerable to path traversal prior to versions 2.39.2, 2.38.4, 2.37.6,     2.36.5, 2.35.7, 2.34.7, 2.33.7, 2.32.6, 2.31.7, and 2.30.8. By feeding a crafted input to `git apply`, a     path outside the working tree can be overwritten as the user who is running `git apply`. A fix has been     prepared and will appear in v2.39.2, v2.38.4, v2.37.6, v2.36.5, v2.35.7, v2.34.7, v2.33.7, v2.32.6,     v2.31.7, and v2.30.8.

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities:\n\n  - Eclipse Jetty provides a web server and servlet container. In versions 11.0.0 through 11.0.15, 10.0.0     through 10.0.15, and 9.0.0 through 9.4.52, an integer overflow in `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for     HTTP/2 HPACK header values to exceed their size limit. `MetaDataBuilder.java` determines if a header name     or value exceeds the size limit, and throws an exception if the limit is exceeded. However, when length is     very large and huffman is true, the multiplication by 4 in line 295 will overflow, and length will become     negative. `(_size+length)` will now be negative, and the check on line 296 will not be triggered.\n    Furthermore, `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for user-entered HPACK header value sizes to be negative,     potentially leading to a very large buffer allocation later on when the user-entered size is multiplied by     2. This means that if a user provides a negative length value (or, more precisely, a length value which,     when multiplied by the 4/3 fudge factor, is negative), and this length value is a very large positive     number when multiplied by 2, then the user can cause a very large buffer to be allocated on the server.\n    Users of HTTP/2 can be impacted by a remote denial of service attack.

remote host is prior to 1.0.2zg. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the 1.0.2zg advisory.\n\n  - There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName.\n    X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME     incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently     interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL     checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may     allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or     enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate     chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these     inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is     uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented     their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network. Thanks to David Benjamin (Google). Fix     developed by Hugo Landau. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zg (Affected since 1.0.2). (CVE-2023-0286)\n\n  - The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is     primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may     also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a     new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the     BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid,     the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this     case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal     pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then     a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the     internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call     BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions     PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream, SMIME_write_ASN1,     SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7. Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include     i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream. The OpenSSL     cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected. Thanks to Octavio Galland (Max Planck     Institute for Security and Privacy). Thanks to Marcel Bhme (Max Planck Institute for Security and     Privacy). Fix developed by Viktor Dukhovni. Fix developed by Matt Caswell. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zg     (Affected since 1.0.2). (CVE-2023-0215)\n\n  - A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient     to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful     decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption.\n    The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS     connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An     attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send     trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number     of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be     able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zg (Affected since     1.0.2).

a package installed that is affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the USN-5982-1 advisory.\n\n  - A regression exists in the Linux Kernel within KVM: nVMX that allowed for speculative execution attacks.\n    L2 can carry out Spectre v2 attacks on L1 due to L1 thinking it doesn't need retpolines or IBPB after     running L2 due to KVM (L0) advertising eIBRS support to L1. An attacker at L2 with code execution can     execute code on an indirect branch on the host machine. We recommend upgrading to Kernel 6.2 or past     commit 2e7eab81425a (CVE-2022-2196)\n\n  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SGI GRU driver in the way the first     gru_file_unlocked_ioctl function is called by the user, where a fail pass occurs in the     gru_check_chiplet_assignment function. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate     their privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-3424)\n\n  - An out-of-bounds(OOB) memory access vulnerability was found in vmwgfx driver in     drivers/gpu/vmxgfx/vmxgfx_kms.c in GPU component in the Linux kernel with device file '/dev/dri/renderD128     (or Dxxx)'. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user account on the system to gain privilege, causing     a denial of service(DoS). (CVE-2022-36280)\n\n  - In drivers/media/dvb-core/dmxdev.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.10, there is a use-after-free caused     by refcount races, affecting dvb_demux_open and dvb_dmxdev_release. (CVE-2022-41218)\n\n  - A use-after-free flaw caused by a race among the superblock operations in the gadgetfs Linux driver was     found. It could be triggered by yanking out a device that is running the gadgetfs side. (CVE-2022-4382)\n\n  - In the Linux kernel before 6.1.3, fs/ntfs3/record.c does not validate resident attribute names. An out-of-     bounds write may occur. (CVE-2022-48423)\n\n  - In the Linux kernel before 6.1.3, fs/ntfs3/inode.c does not validate the attribute name offset. An     unhandled page fault may occur. (CVE-2022-48424)\n\n  - The current implementation of the prctl syscall does not issue an IBPB immediately during the syscall. The     ib_prctl_set function updates the Thread Information Flags (TIFs) for the task and updates the SPEC_CTRL     MSR on the function __speculation_ctrl_update, but the IBPB is only issued on the next schedule, when the     TIF bits are checked. This leaves the victim vulnerable to values already injected on the BTB, prior to     the prctl syscall. The patch that added the support for the conditional mitigation via prctl     (ib_prctl_set) dates back to the kernel 4.9.176. We recommend upgrading past commit     a664ec9158eeddd75121d39c9a0758016097fa96 (CVE-2023-0045)\n\n  - A bug affects the Linux kernel's ksmbd NTLMv2 authentication and is known to crash the OS immediately in     Linux-based systems. (CVE-2023-0210)\n\n  - A use after free vulnerability exists in the ALSA PCM package in the Linux Kernel.\n    SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_{READ|WRITE}32 is missing locks that can be used in a use-after-free that can result     in a priviledge escalation to gain ring0 access from the system user. We recommend upgrading past commit     56b88b50565cd8b946a2d00b0c83927b7ebb055e (CVE-2023-0266)\n\n  - cbq_classify in net/sched/sch_cbq.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers to cause a denial     of service (slab-out-of-bounds read) because of type confusion (non-negative numbers can sometimes     indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition rather than valid classification results). (CVE-2023-23454)\n\n  - atm_tc_enqueue in net/sched/sch_atm.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers to cause a denial     of service because of type confusion (non-negative numbers can sometimes indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition     rather than valid classification results). (CVE-2023-23455)\n\n  - In rndis_query_oid in drivers/net/wireless/rndis_wlan.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.5, there is an     integer overflow in an addition. (CVE-2023-23559)\n\n  - In the Linux kernel 6.0.8, there is a use-after-free in ntfs_trim_fs in fs/ntfs3/bitmap.c.\n    (CVE-2023-26606)\n\n  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the az6027 driver in drivers/media/usb/dev-usb/az6027.c in     the Linux Kernel. The message from user space is not checked properly before transferring into the device.\n    This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or potentially cause a denial of service.\n    (CVE-2023-28328)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.","exploit_available":true,"exploit_framework_canvas":false,"exploit_framework_core":false,"exploit_framework_d2_elliot":false,"exploit_framework_exploithub":false,"exploit_framework_metasploit":false,"exploitability_ease":"Exploits are available","exploited_by_malware":false,"exploited_by_nessus":false,"family":"Ubuntu Local Security Checks","family_id":58,"has_patch":true,"id":173621,"in_the_news":false,"name":"Ubuntu 20.04 LTS / 22.04 LTS : Linux kernel vulnerabilities (USN-5982-1)","patch_publication_date":"2023-03-28T00:00:00Z","modification_date":"2024-01-09T00:00:00Z","publication_date":"2023-03-28T00:00:00Z","risk_factor":"high","see_also":["https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5982-1"],"solution":"Update the affected kernel package.","synopsis":"The remote Ubuntu host is missing one or more security updates.","unsupported_by_vendor":false,"usn":"5982-1","version":"1.4","vuln_publication_date":"2022-09-09T00:00:00Z","xrefs":[{"type":"CISA-KNOWN-EXPLOITED","id":"2023/04/20"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-2196"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-3424"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-36280"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-41218"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-4382"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-48423"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-48424"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-0045"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-0210"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-0266"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-23454"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-23455"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-23559"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-26606"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-28328"},{"type":"USN","id":"5982-1"}],"vpr":{"score":7.4,"drivers":{"age_of_vuln":{"lower_bound":366,"upper_bound":730},"exploit_code_maturity":"FUNCTIONAL","cvss_impact_score_predicted":false,"cvss3_impact_score":5.9,"threat_intensity_last28":"VERY_LOW","threat_recency":{"lower_bound":31,"upper_bound":120},"threat_sources_last28":["No recorded events"],"product_coverage":"LOW"},"updated":"2024-01-31T06:01:46Z"},"cve":["CVE-2022-2196","CVE-2022-3424","CVE-2022-36280","CVE-2022-41218","CVE-2022-4382","CVE-2022-48423","CVE-2022-48424","CVE-2023-0045","CVE-2023-0210","CVE-2023-0266","CVE-2023-23454","CVE-2023-23455","CVE-2023-23559","CVE-2023-26606","CVE-2023-28328"],"type":"local"},"port":{"port":0,"protocol":"TCP"},"scan":{"schedule_uuid":"template-dc6873ce-017a-0f45-e33f-82a067333cc80975a6cd4824e898","started_at":"2024-03-11T00:13:15Z","uuid":"6f80368c-99c3-73e3-611d-1a70529f1043"},"severity":"high","severity_id":3,"severity_default_id":3,"severity_modification_type":"NONE","first_found":"2023-09-18T19:51:48Z","last_found":"2024-03-11T01:52:21Z","state":"OPEN","indexed":"2024-03-11T02:03:24.045922Z","source":"AGENT"},{"asset":{"agent_uuid":"3750d349904a47d6aef0ef561b8b5f77","bios_uuid":"ec2758b4-b5f3-0bb2-f908-7649584bf9fa","device_type":"aws-ec2-instance","fqdn":"ip-172-20-0-1.us-east-2.compute.internal","hostname":"trh-agent","uuid":"5fcc163c-ce62-4abc-b655-5bab9ae23bf9","ipv4":"172.20.0.1","ipv6":"fe80::1","last_authenticated_results":"2024-03-11T01:52:21Z","mac_address":"02:42:45:f7:52:4a","operating_system":["Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS (Focal Fossa)"],"network_id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","tracked":true,"assetTags":[{"uuid":"e7cd429e-7660-4f1b-8c58-ffab0fedc01c","key":"testv","value":"123","added_by":"67368e82-4fe4-4447-ba6f-ea1f7120c52c","added_at":"2023-10-06T13:07:56.676Z"}]},"output":"\n  -

This can allow for credentials in the     authorization header to be exposed to unintended hosts or transmitted in cleartext. NOTE: this issue     exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-20060 (which was case-sensitive). (CVE-2018-25091)\n\n  - urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 doesn't treat the `Cookie` HTTP header     special or provide any helpers for managing cookies over HTTP, that is the responsibility of the user.\n    However, it is possible for a user to specify a `Cookie` header and unknowingly leak information via HTTP     redirects to a different origin if that user doesn't disable redirects explicitly. This issue has been     patched in urllib3 version 1.26.17 or 2.0.5. (CVE-2023-43804)\n\n  - urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP     request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 301, 302, or 303 after the request had its method     changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs.\n    Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing     together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client     implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted     service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability     of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request     bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions     must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information     in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts     redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised.\n    This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve     this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond     with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle     301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body. (CVE-2023-45803)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version

packages installed that are affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the USN-6201-1 advisory.\n\n  - When Firefox is configured to block storage of all cookies, it was still possible to store data in     localstorage by using an iframe with a source of 'about:blank'. This could have led to malicious websites     storing tracking data without permission. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 115. (CVE-2023-3482)\n\n  - An attacker could have triggered a use-after-free condition when creating a WebRTC connection over HTTPS.\n    This vulnerability affects Firefox < 115, Firefox ESR < 102.13, and Thunderbird < 102.13. (CVE-2023-37201)\n\n  - Cross-compartment wrappers wrapping a scripted proxy could have caused objects from other compartments to     be stored in the main compartment resulting in a use-after-free. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 115,     Firefox ESR < 102.13, and Thunderbird < 102.13. (CVE-2023-37202)\n\n  - Insufficient validation in the Drag and Drop API in conjunction with social engineering, may have allowed     an attacker to trick end-users into creating a shortcut to local system files. This could have been     leveraged to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 115. (CVE-2023-37203)\n\n  - A website could have obscured the fullscreen notification by using an option element by introducing lag     via an expensive computational function. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing     attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 115. (CVE-2023-37204)\n\n  - The use of RTL Arabic characters in the address bar may have allowed for URL spoofing. This vulnerability     affects Firefox < 115. (CVE-2023-37205)\n\n  - Uploading files which contain symlinks may have allowed an attacker to trick a user into submitting     sensitive data to a malicious website. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 115. (CVE-2023-37206)\n\n  - A website could have obscured the fullscreen notification by using a URL with a scheme handled by an     external program, such as a mailto URL. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing     attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 115, Firefox ESR < 102.13, and Thunderbird < 102.13.\n    (CVE-2023-37207)\n\n  - When opening Diagcab files, Firefox did not warn the user that these files may contain malicious code.\n    This vulnerability affects Firefox < 115, Firefox ESR < 102.13, and Thunderbird < 102.13. (CVE-2023-37208)\n\n  - A use-after-free condition existed in `NotifyOnHistoryReload` where a `LoadingSessionHistoryEntry` object     was freed and a reference to that object remained. This resulted in a potentially exploitable condition     when the reference to that object was later reused. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 115.\n    (CVE-2023-37209)\n\n  - A website could prevent a user from exiting full-screen mode via alert and prompt calls. This could lead     to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 115.\n    (CVE-2023-37210)\n\n  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 114, Firefox ESR 102.12, and Thunderbird 102.12. Some of these bugs     showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been     exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 115, Firefox ESR < 102.13, and     Thunderbird < 102.13. (CVE-2023-37211)\n\n  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 114. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we     presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

to its self-reported version number, the installation of Apache Log4j on the remote host is 1.x and is no longer supported. Log4j reached its end of life prior to 2016. Additionally, Log4j 1.x is affected by multiple vulnerabilities, including :\n\n  - Log4j includes a SocketServer that accepts serialized log events and deserializes them without verifying whether     the objects are allowed or not. This can provide an attack vector that can be exploited. (CVE-2019-17571)\n\n  - Improper validation of certificate with host mismatch in Apache Log4j SMTP appender. This could allow an SMTPS     connection to be intercepted by a man-in-the-middle attack which could leak any log messages sent through that     appender. (CVE-2020-9488)\n\n  - JMSSink uses JNDI in an unprotected manner allowing any application using the JMSSink to be vulnerable if it is     configured to reference an untrusted site or if the site referenced can be accesseed by the attacker.\n    (CVE-2022-23302)\n\nLack of support implies that no new security patches for the product will be released by the vendor. As a result, it is likely to contain security vulnerabilities.","exploit_available":true,"exploit_framework_canvas":false,"exploit_framework_core":false,"exploit_framework_d2_elliot":false,"exploit_framework_exploithub":false,"exploit_framework_metasploit":false,"exploitability_ease":"Exploits are available","exploited_by_malware":false,"exploited_by_nessus":false,"family":"Misc.","family_id":3,"has_patch":false,"id":156860,"in_the_news":false,"name":"Apache Log4j 1.x Multiple Vulnerabilities","modification_date":"2023-11-20T00:00:00Z","publication_date":"2022-01-19T00:00:00Z","risk_factor":"high","see_also":["https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/"],"solution":"Upgrade to a version of Apache Log4j that is currently supported.\n\nUpgrading to the latest versions for Apache Log4j is highly recommended as intermediate versions / patches have known high severity vulnerabilities and the vendor is updating their advisories often as new research and knowledge about the impact of Log4j is discovered.

By design, cookie headers are     forbidden request headers, disallowing them to be set in RequestInit.headers in browser environments.\n    Since undici handles headers more liberally than the spec, there was a disconnect from the assumptions the     spec made, and undici's implementation of fetch. As such this may lead to accidental leakage of cookie to     a 3rd-party site or a malicious attacker who can control the redirection target (ie. an open redirector)     to leak the cookie to the 3rd party site. More details area available in GHSA-wqq4-5wpv-mx2g     (CVE-2023-45143)\n\n  - Rapidly creating and cancelling streams (HEADERS frame immediately followed by RST_STREAM) without bound     causes denial of service. See https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-44487 for details. Impacts:\n    (CVE-2023-44487)\n\n  - A previously disclosed vulnerability (CVE-2023-30584) was patched insufficiently. The new path traversal     vulnerability arises because the implementation does not protect itself against the application     overwriting built-in utility functions with user-defined implementations. Impacts: Please note that at the     time this CVE is issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js. Thanks to Tobias     Nieen who reported and created the security patch. (CVE-2023-39331)\n\n  - Various node:fs functions allow specifying paths as either strings or Uint8Array objects. In Node.js     environments, the Buffer class extends the Uint8Array class. Node.js prevents path traversal through     strings (see CVE-2023-30584) and Buffer objects (see CVE-2023-32004), but not through non-Buffer     Uint8Array objects. This is distinct from CVE-2023-32004 (report 2038134), which only referred to Buffer     objects. However, the vulnerability follows the same pattern using Uint8Array instead of Buffer. Impacts:\n    Please note that at the time this CVE is issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of     Node.js. Thanks to Tobias Nieen who reported and created the security patch. (CVE-2023-39332)\n\n  - When the Node.js policy feature checks the integrity of a resource against a trusted manifest, the     application can intercept the operation and return a forged checksum to node's policy implementation, thus     effectively disabling the integrity check. Impacts: Please note that at the time this CVE is issued, the     policy mechanism is an experimental feature of Node.js. Thanks to Tobias Nieen who reported and created     the security patch. (CVE-2023-38552)\n\n  - Maliciously crafted export names in an imported WebAssembly module can inject JavaScript code. The     injected code may be able to access data and functions that the WebAssembly module itself does not have     access to, similar to as if the WebAssembly module was a JavaScript module.

NULL Pointer Dereference in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4959. (CVE-2022-1725)\n\n  - Uncontrolled Recursion in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4975. (CVE-2022-1771)\n\n  - Heap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-1886)\n\n  - Out-of-bounds Write in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-1897, CVE-2022-2000)\n\n  - Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-2042)\n\n  - Vim is an improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Heap-use-after-free in memory allocated in the     function `ga_grow_inner` in in the file `src/alloc.c` at line 748, which is freed in the file     `src/ex_docmd.c` in the function `do_cmdline` at line 1010 and then used again in `src/cmdhist.c` at line     759. When using the `:history` command, it's possible that the provided argument overflows the accepted     value. Causing an Integer Overflow and potentially later an use-after-free. This vulnerability has been     patched in version 9.0.2068. (CVE-2023-46246)\n\n  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When closing a window, vim may try to access already freed     window structure. Exploitation beyond crashing the application has not been shown to be viable. This issue     has been addressed in commit `25aabc2b` which has been included in release version 9.0.2106. Users are     advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48231)\n\n  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. A floating point exception may occur when calculating the     line offset for overlong lines and smooth scrolling is enabled and the cpo-settings include the 'n' flag.\n    This may happen when a window border is present and when the wrapped line continues on the next physical     line directly in the window border because the 'cpo' setting includes the 'n' flag. Only users with non-     default settings are affected and the exception should only result in a crash. This issue has been     addressed in commit `cb0b99f0` which has been included in release version 9.0.2107. Users are advised to     upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48232)\n\n  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. If the count after the :s command is larger than what fits     into a (signed) long variable, abort with e_value_too_large. Impact is low, user interaction is required     and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `ac6378773`     which has been included in release version 9.0.2108. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known     workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48233)\n\n  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When getting the count for a normal mode z command, it may     overflow for large counts given. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even     happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `58f9befca1` which has been included in     release version 9.0.2109. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this     vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48234)\n\n  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When parsing relative ex addresses one may unintentionally     cause an overflow. Ironically this happens in the existing overflow check, because the line number becomes     negative and LONG_MAX - lnum will cause the overflow. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a     crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `060623e` which has     been included in release version 9.0.2110. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds     for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48235)\n\n  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When using the z= command, the user may overflow the count     with values larger than MAX_INT. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even     happen in all situations. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `73b2d379` which has been     included in release version 9.0.2111. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for     this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48236)\n\n  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. In affected versions when shifting lines in operator     pending mode and using a very large value, it may be possible to overflow the size of integer. Impact is     low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been     addressed in commit `6bf131888` which has been included in version 9.0.2112. Users are advised to upgrade.\n    There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48237)\n\n  - Vim is a UNIX editor that, prior to version 9.0.2121, has a heap-use-after-free vulnerability. When     executing a `:s` command for the very first time and using a sub-replace-special atom inside the     substitution part, it is possible that the recursive `:s` call causes free-ing of memory which may later     then be accessed by the initial `:s` command. The user must intentionally execute the payload and the     whole process is a bit tricky to do since it seems to work only reliably for the very first :s command. It     may also cause a crash of Vim. Version 9.0.2121 contains a fix for this issue. (CVE-2023-48706)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version

combination of     <code>window.open</code>, fullscreen requests, <code>window.name</code> assignments, and     <code>setInterval</code> calls. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks.\n    (CVE-2023-29533)\n\n  - Following a Garbage Collector compaction, weak maps may have been accessed before they were correctly     traced. This resulted in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.  (CVE-2023-29535)\n\n  - An attacker could cause the memory manager to incorrectly free a pointer that addresses attacker-     controlled memory, resulting in an assertion, memory corruption, or a potentially exploitable crash.\n    (CVE-2023-29536)\n\n  - Multiple race conditions in the font initialization could have led to memory corruption and execution of     attacker-controlled code.  (CVE-2023-29537)\n\n  - Under specific circumstances a WebExtension may have received a <code>jar:file:///</code> URI instead of a     <code>moz-extension:///</code> URI during a load request. This leaked directory paths on the user's     machine.  (CVE-2023-29538)\n\n  - When handling the filename directive in the Content-Disposition header, the filename would be truncated if     the filename contained a NULL character. This could have led to reflected file download attacks     potentially tricking users to install malware.  (CVE-2023-29539)\n\n  - Using a redirect embedded into <code>sourceMappingUrls</code> could allow for navigation to external     protocol links in sandboxed iframes without <code>allow-top-navigation-to-custom-protocols</code>.\n    (CVE-2023-29540)\n\n  - Firefox did not properly handle downloads of files ending in <code>.desktop</code>, which can be     interpreted to run attacker-controlled commands.  This bug only affects Firefox for Linux on certain     Distributions. Other operating systems are unaffected, and Mozilla is unable to enumerate all affected     Linux Distributions.  (CVE-2023-29541)\n\n  - An attacker could have caused memory corruption and a potentially exploitable use-after-free of a pointer     in a global object's debugger vector.  (CVE-2023-29543)\n\n  - If multiple instances of resource exhaustion occurred at the incorrect time, the garbage collector could     have caused memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.  (CVE-2023-29544)\n\n  - When a secure cookie existed in the Firefox cookie jar an insecure cookie for the same domain could have     been created, when it should have silently failed.  This could have led to a desynchronization in expected     results when reading from the secure cookie.  (CVE-2023-29547)\n\n  - A wrong lowering instruction in the ARM64 Ion compiler resulted in a wrong optimization result.\n    (CVE-2023-29548)\n\n  - Under certain circumstances, a call to the <code>bind</code> function may have resulted in the incorrect     realm.  This may have created a vulnerability relating to JavaScript-implemented sandboxes such as SES.\n    (CVE-2023-29549)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Andrew Osmond, Sebastian Hengst, Andrew McCreight, and the Mozilla     Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 111 and Firefox ESR 102.9. Some of these bugs     showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been     exploited to run arbitrary code.

microarchitectural state after transient execution in certain vector     execution units for some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable     information disclosure via local access. (CVE-2022-40982)\n\n  - An issue in Zen 2 CPUs, under specific microarchitectural circumstances, may allow an attacker to     potentially access sensitive information. (CVE-2023-20593)\n\n  - In multiple functions of io_uring.c, there is a possible kernel memory corruption due to improper locking.\n    This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with System execution privileges needed.\n    User interaction is not needed for exploitation. (CVE-2023-21400)\n\n  - A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_u32 component can be exploited to     achieve local privilege escalation. If tcf_change_indev() fails, u32_set_parms() will immediately return     an error after incrementing or decrementing the reference counter in tcf_bind_filter(). If an attacker can     control the reference counter and set it to zero, they can cause the reference to be freed, leading to a     use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading past commit 04c55383fa5689357bcdd2c8036725a55ed632bc.\n    (CVE-2023-3609)\n\n  - A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to     achieve local privilege escalation. Flaw in the error handling of bound chains causes a use-after-free in     the abort path of NFT_MSG_NEWRULE. The vulnerability requires CAP_NET_ADMIN to be triggered. We recommend     upgrading past commit 4bedf9eee016286c835e3d8fa981ddece5338795. (CVE-2023-3610)\n\n  - An out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_qfq component can be exploited     to achieve local privilege escalation. The qfq_change_agg() function in net/sched/sch_qfq.c allows an out-     of-bounds write because lmax is updated according to packet sizes without bounds checks. We recommend     upgrading past commit 3e337087c3b5805fe0b8a46ba622a962880b5d64. (CVE-2023-3611)\n\n  - A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_fw component can be exploited to     achieve local privilege escalation. If tcf_change_indev() fails, fw_set_parms() will immediately return an     error after incrementing or decrementing the reference counter in tcf_bind_filter(). If an attacker can     control the reference counter and set it to zero, they can cause the reference to be freed, leading to a     use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading past commit 0323bce598eea038714f941ce2b22541c46d488f.\n    (CVE-2023-3776)\n\n  - A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to     achieve local privilege escalation. When nf_tables_delrule() is flushing table rules, it is not checked     whether the chain is bound and the chain's owner rule can also release the objects in certain     circumstances. We recommend upgrading past commit 6eaf41e87a223ae6f8e7a28d6e78384ad7e407f8.\n    (CVE-2023-3777)\n\n  - Rejected reason: This CVE ID has been rejected or withdrawn by its CVE Numbering Authority because it is a     duplicate of CVE-2023-4147. (CVE-2023-3995)\n\n  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's netfilter in the way a user triggers the     nft_pipapo_remove function with the element, without a NFT_SET_EXT_KEY_END. This issue could allow a local     user to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2023-4004)\n\n  - A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to     achieve local privilege escalation. On an error when building a nftables rule, deactivating immediate     expressions in nft_immediate_deactivate() can lead unbinding the chain and objects be deactivated but     later used. We recommend upgrading past commit 0a771f7b266b02d262900c75f1e175c7fe76fec2.

An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path     when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name     being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service.

Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A     client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory     footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run     out of memory before that. This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid     Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During normal HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is     very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out. Users are     recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the Wednesday February 14 2024 Security Releases advisory.\n\n  - On Linux, Node.js ignores certain environment variables if those may have been set by an unprivileged user     while the process is running with elevated privileges with the only exception of CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE. Due     to a bug in the implementation of this exception, Node.js incorrectly applies this exception even when     certain other capabilities have been set. This allows unprivileged users to inject code that inherits the     process's elevated privileges. Impacts: Thank you, to Tobias Nieen for reporting this vulnerability and     for fixing it. (CVE-2024-21892)\n\n  - A vulnerability in Node.js HTTP servers allows an attacker to send a specially crafted HTTP request with     chunked encoding, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service (DoS). The server reads an     unbounded number of bytes from a single connection, exploiting the lack of limitations on chunk extension     bytes. The issue can cause CPU and network bandwidth exhaustion, bypassing standard safeguards like     timeouts and body size limits. Impacts: Thank you, to Bartek Nowotarski for reporting this vulnerability     and thank you Paolo Insogna for fixing it. (CVE-2024-22019)\n\n  - The permission model protects itself against path traversal attacks by calling path.resolve() on any paths     given by the user. If the path is to be treated as a Buffer, the implementation uses Buffer.from() to     obtain a Buffer from the result of path.resolve(). By monkey-patching Buffer internals, namely,     Buffer.prototype.utf8Write, the application can modify the result of path.resolve(), which leads to a path     traversal vulnerability. Impacts: Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model     is an experimental feature of Node.js. Thank you, to Tobias Nieen for reporting this vulnerability and     for fixing it. (CVE-2024-21896)\n\n  - setuid() does not affect libuv's internal io_uring operations if initialized before the call to setuid().\n    This allows the process to perform privileged operations despite presumably having dropped such privileges     through a call to setuid(). Impacts: Thank you, to valette for reporting this vulnerability and thank you     Tobias Nieen for fixing it. (CVE-2024-22017)\n\n  - A vulnerability in the privateDecrypt() API of the crypto library, allowed a covert timing side-channel     during PKCS#1 v1.5 padding error handling. The vulnerability revealed significant timing differences in     decryption for valid and invalid ciphertexts. This poses a serious threat as attackers could remotely     exploit the vulnerability to decrypt captured RSA ciphertexts or forge signatures, especially in scenarios     involving API endpoints processing Json Web Encryption messages. Impacts: Thank you, to hkario for     reporting this vulnerability and thank you Michael Dawson for fixing it. (CVE-2023-46809)\n\n  - Node.js depends on multiple built-in utility functions to normalize paths provided to node:fs functions,     which can be overwitten with user-defined implementations leading to filesystem permission model bypass     through path traversal attack. Impacts: Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission     model is an experimental feature of Node.js. Thank you, to xion for reporting this vulnerability and thank     you Rafael Gonzaga for fixing it. (CVE-2024-21891)\n\n  - The Node.js Permission Model does not clarify in the documentation that wildcards should be only used as     the last character of a file path. For example: --allow-fs-read=/home/node/.ssh/*.pub will ignore pub and     give access to everything after .ssh/. Impacts: Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the     permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js. Thank you, to Tobias Nieen for reporting this     vulnerability and thank you Rafael Gonzaga for fixing it.

When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other     places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command     executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is     automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the     privileges of the script.

When curl is given a hostname to pass along to a SOCKS5 proxy that is greater than 255 bytes in     length, it will switch to local name resolution in order to resolve the address before passing it on to     the SOCKS5 proxy. However, due to a bug introduced in 2020, this local name resolution could fail due to a     slow SOCKS5 handshake, causing curl to pass on the hostname greater than 255 bytes in length into the     target buffer, leading to a heap overflow.  The advisory for CVE-2023-38545 gives an example exploitation     scenario of a malicious HTTPS server redirecting to a specially crafted URL. While it might seem that an     attacker would need to influence the slowness of the SOCKS5 handshake, the advisory states that server     latency is likely slow enough to trigger this bug. (CVE-2023-38545)\n\n  - CVE-2023-38546 is a cookie injection vulnerability in the curl_easy_duphandle(), a function in libcurl     that duplicates easy handles.  When duplicating an easy handle, if cookies are enabled, the duplicated     easy handle will not duplicate the cookies themselves, but would instead set the filename to none.'     Therefore, when the duplicated easy handle is subsequently used, if a source was not set for the cookies,     libcurl would attempt to load them from the file named none' on the disk.  This vulnerability is rated     low, as the various conditions required for exploitation are unlikely.

One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the     protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG     records. (CVE-2023-50387)\n\n  - The Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol (in RFC 5155 when RFC 9276 guidance is skipped)     allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption for SHA-1 computations) via DNSSEC     responses in a random subdomain attack, aka the NSEC3 issue. The RFC 5155 specification implies that an     algorithm must perform thousands of iterations of a hash function in certain situations. (CVE-2023-50868)\n\n  - A flaw in query-handling code can cause `named` to exit prematurely with an assertion failure when: -     `nxdomain-redirect <domain>;` is configured, and - the resolver receives a PTR query for an RFC 1918     address that would normally result in an authoritative NXDOMAIN response. This issue affects BIND 9     versions 9.12.0 through 9.16.45, 9.18.0 through 9.18.21, 9.19.0 through 9.19.19, 9.16.8-S1 through     9.16.45-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.21-S1. (CVE-2023-5517)\n\n  - To keep its cache database efficient, `named` running as a recursive resolver occasionally attempts to     clean up the database. It uses several methods, including some that are asynchronous: a small chunk of     memory pointing to the cache element that can be cleaned up is first allocated and then queued for later     processing. It was discovered that if the resolver is continuously processing query patterns triggering     this type of cache-database maintenance, `named` may not be able to handle the cleanup events in a timely     manner.

The existing KVM SEV API has a vulnerability that allows a non-root     (host) user-level application to crash the host kernel by creating a confidential guest VM instance in AMD     CPU that supports Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). (CVE-2022-0171)\n\n  - In binder_inc_ref_for_node of binder.c, there is a possible way to corrupt memory due to a use after free.\n    This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User     interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID:\n    A-239630375References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2022-20421)\n\n  - An issue was found in the Linux kernel in nf_conntrack_irc where the message handling can be confused and     incorrectly matches the message. A firewall may be able to be bypassed when users are using unencrypted     IRC with nf_conntrack_irc configured. (CVE-2022-2663)\n\n  - Found Linux Kernel flaw in the i740 driver. The Userspace program could pass any values to the driver     through ioctl() interface. The driver doesn't check the value of 'pixclock', so it may cause a divide by     zero error. (CVE-2022-3061)\n\n  - A race condition flaw was found in the Linux kernel sound subsystem due to improper locking. It could lead     to a NULL pointer dereference while handling the SNDCTL_DSP_SYNC ioctl. A privileged local user (root or     member of the audio group) could use this flaw to crash the system, resulting in a denial of service     condition (CVE-2022-3303)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's networking code. A use-after-free was found in the way the sch_sfb     enqueue function used the socket buffer (SKB) cb field after the same SKB had been enqueued (and freed)     into a child qdisc. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to crash the system, causing a denial of     service. (CVE-2022-3586)\n\n  - A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in Linux Kernel. This issue affects     the function nilfs_attach_log_writer of the file fs/nilfs2/segment.c of the component BPF. The     manipulation leads to memory leak. The attack may be initiated remotely. It is recommended to apply a     patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211961 was assigned to this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3646)\n\n  - A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function     nilfs_new_inode of the file fs/nilfs2/inode.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to use after     free. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.\n    The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211992. (CVE-2022-3649)\n\n  - An issue was discovered in include/asm-generic/tlb.h in the Linux kernel before 5.19. Because of a race     condition (unmap_mapping_range versus munmap), a device driver can free a page while it still has stale     TLB entries. This only occurs in situations with VM_PFNMAP VMAs. (CVE-2022-39188)\n\n  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.19. In pxa3xx_gcu_write in     drivers/video/fbdev/pxa3xx-gcu.c, the count parameter has a type conflict of size_t versus int, causing an     integer overflow and bypassing the size check. After that, because it is used as the third argument to     copy_from_user(), a heap overflow may occur. NOTE: the original discoverer disputes that the overflow can     actually happen. (CVE-2022-39842)\n\n  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.19.8. drivers/firmware/efi/capsule-loader.c has a     race condition with a resultant use-after-free. (CVE-2022-40307)\n\n  - A use-after-free flaw was found in Linux kernel before 5.19.2. This issue occurs in cmd_hdl_filter in     drivers/staging/rtl8712/rtl8712_cmd.c, allowing an attacker to launch a local denial of service attack and     gain escalation of privileges. (CVE-2022-4095)\n\n  - drivers/usb/mon/mon_bin.c in usbmon in the Linux kernel before 5.19.15 and 6.x before 6.0.1 allows a user-     space client to corrupt the monitor's internal memory.

Mishandled error handling with NFT_MSG_NEWRULE makes it possible to use a     dangling pointer in the same transaction causing a use-after-free vulnerability. This flaw allows a local     attacker with user access to cause a privilege escalation issue. We recommend upgrading past commit     1240eb93f0616b21c675416516ff3d74798fdc97. (CVE-2023-3390)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the MCTP protocol in the Linux kernel. The function mctp_unregister() reclaims the     device's relevant resource when a netcard detaches. However, a running routine may be unaware of this and     cause the use-after-free of the mdev->addrs object, potentially leading to a denial of service.\n    (CVE-2023-3439)\n\n  - Linux Kernel nftables Out-Of-Bounds Read/Write Vulnerability; nft_byteorder poorly handled vm register     contents when CAP_NET_ADMIN is in any user or network namespace (CVE-2023-35001)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.","exploit_available":true,"exploit_framework_canvas":false,"exploit_framework_core":false,"exploit_framework_d2_elliot":false,"exploit_framework_exploithub":false,"exploit_framework_metasploit":false,"exploitability_ease":"Exploits are available","exploited_by_malware":false,"exploited_by_nessus":false,"family":"Ubuntu Local Security Checks","family_id":58,"has_patch":true,"id":178794,"in_the_news":false,"name":"Ubuntu 20.04 LTS / 22.04 LTS : Linux kernel vulnerabilities (USN-6246-1)","patch_publication_date":"2023-07-25T00:00:00Z","modification_date":"2024-01-09T00:00:00Z","publication_date":"2023-07-26T00:00:00Z","risk_factor":"medium","see_also":["https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6246-1"],"solution":"Update the affected kernel package.","synopsis":"The remote Ubuntu host is missing one or more security updates.","unsupported_by_vendor":false,"usn":"6246-1","version":"1.3","vuln_publication_date":"2023-06-21T00:00:00Z","xrefs":[{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-3090"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-31248"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-3389"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-3390"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-3439"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-35001"},{"type":"USN","id":"6246-1"}],"vpr":{"score":9.0,"drivers":{"age_of_vuln":{"lower_bound":181,"upper_bound":365},"exploit_code_maturity":"UNPROVEN","cvss_impact_score_predicted":false,"cvss3_impact_score":5.9,"threat_intensity_last28":"VERY_LOW","threat_recency":{"lower_bound":31,"upper_bound":120},"threat_sources_last28":["No recorded events"],"product_coverage":"HIGH"},"updated":"2024-03-07T06:04:40Z"},"cve":["CVE-2023-3090","CVE-2023-31248","CVE-2023-3389","CVE-2023-3390","CVE-2023-3439","CVE-2023-35001"],"type":"local"},"port":{"port":0,"protocol":"TCP"},"scan":{"schedule_uuid":"template-dc6873ce-017a-0f45-e33f-82a067333cc80975a6cd4824e898","started_at":"2024-03-11T00:13:15Z","uuid":"6f80368c-99c3-73e3-611d-1a70529f1043"},"severity":"high","severity_id":3,"severity_default_id":2,"severity_modification_type":"NONE","first_found":"2023-09-18T19:51:48Z","last_found":"2024-03-11T01:52:21Z","state":"OPEN","indexed":"2024-03-11T02:03:27.200011Z","source":"AGENT"},{"asset":{"agent_uuid":"3750d349904a47d6aef0ef561b8b5f77","bios_uuid":"ec2758b4-b5f3-0bb2-f908-7649584bf9fa","device_type":"aws-ec2-instance","fqdn":"ip-172-20-0-1.us-east-2.compute.internal","hostname":"trh-agent","uuid":"5fcc163c-ce62-4abc-b655-5bab9ae23bf9","ipv4":"172.20.0.1","ipv6":"fe80::1","last_authenticated_results":"2024-03-11T01:52:21Z","mac_address":"02:42:45:f7:52:4a","operating_system":["Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS (Focal Fossa)"],"network_id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","tracked":true,"assetTags":[{"uuid":"e7cd429e-7660-4f1b-8c58-ffab0fedc01c","key":"testv","value":"123","added_by":"67368e82-4fe4-4447-ba6f-ea1f7120c52c","added_at":"2023-10-06T13:07:56.676Z"}]},"output":"\n  - Installed package : libnghttp2-14_1.40.0-1build1\n  - Fixed package     : libnghttp2-14_1.40.0-1ubuntu0.2\n\n","plugin":{"bid":[186192],"checks_for_default_account":false,"checks_for_malware":false,"cpe":["cpe:/o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:20.04:-:lts","cpe:/o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:22.04:-:lts","cpe:/o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:23.04","cpe:/o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:23.10","p-cpe:/a:canonical:ubuntu_linux:libnghttp2-14","p-cpe:/a:canonical:ubuntu_linux:libnghttp2-dev","p-cpe:/a:canonical:ubuntu_linux:nghttp2","p-cpe:/a:canonical:ubuntu_linux:nghttp2-client","p-cpe:/a:canonical:ubuntu_linux:nghttp2-proxy","p-cpe:/a:canonical:ubuntu_linux:nghttp2-server"],"cvss3_base_score":7.5,"cvss3_temporal_score":7.0,"cvss3_temporal_vector":{"exploitability":"Functional","remediation_level":"Official Fix","report_confidence":"Confirmed","raw":"E:F/RL:O/RC:C"},"cvss3_vector":{"access_complexity":"Low","access_vector":"Network","availability_impact":"High","confidentiality_impact":"None","integrity_impact":"None","raw":"AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"cvss_base_score":7.8,"cvss_temporal_score":6.4,"cvss_temporal_vector":{"exploitability":"Functional","remediation_level":"Official Fix","report_confidence":"Confirmed","raw":"E:F/RL:OF/RC:C"},"cvss_vector":{"access_complexity":"Low","access_vector":"Network","authentication":"None required","availability_impact":"Complete","confidentiality_impact":"None","integrity_impact":"None","raw":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C"},"description":"The remote Ubuntu 20.04 LTS / 22.04 LTS / 23.04 / 23.10 host has packages installed that are affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the USN-6505-1 advisory.\n\n  - The HTTP/2 protocol allows a denial of service (server resource consumption) because request cancellation     can reset many streams quickly, as exploited in the wild in August through October 2023.

host is prior to 1.0.2zd. It is, therefore, affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the 1.0.2zd advisory.\n\n  - The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop     forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain     elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point     encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has     invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the     certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a     denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they     can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients     consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking     certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from     subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that     use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS     issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate     which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the     public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-     signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue     affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the     15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected     1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).

The earliest affected version is 8.9. (CVE-2023-28531)\n\n  - The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other     products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the     extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for     which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because     the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and     mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of     ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and     (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

This can allow for credentials in the     authorization header to be exposed to unintended hosts or transmitted in cleartext. NOTE: this issue     exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-20060 (which was case-sensitive). (CVE-2018-25091)\n\n  - urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 doesn't treat the `Cookie` HTTP header     special or provide any helpers for managing cookies over HTTP, that is the responsibility of the user.\n    However, it is possible for a user to specify a `Cookie` header and unknowingly leak information via HTTP     redirects to a different origin if that user doesn't disable redirects explicitly. This issue has been     patched in urllib3 version 1.26.17 or 2.0.5. (CVE-2023-43804)\n\n  - urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP     request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 301, 302, or 303 after the request had its method     changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs.\n    Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing     together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client     implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted     service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability     of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request     bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions     must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information     in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts     redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised.\n    This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve     this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond     with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle     301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.

A missing lock when clearing     sk_user_data can lead to a race condition and NULL pointer dereference. A local user could use this flaw     to potentially crash the system causing a denial of service. (CVE-2022-4129)\n\n  - In the Linux kernel before 6.1.6, a NULL pointer dereference bug in the traffic control subsystem allows     an unprivileged user to trigger a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted traffic control     configuration that is set up with tc qdisc and tc class commands. This affects qdisc_graft in     net/sched/sch_api.c. (CVE-2022-47929)\n\n  - A flaw NULL Pointer Dereference in the Linux kernel NTFS3 driver function attr_punch_hole() was found. A     local user could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2022-4842)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel, where unauthorized access to the execution of the setuid file with     capabilities was found in the Linux kernel's OverlayFS subsystem in how a user copies a capable file from     a nosuid mount into another mount. This uid mapping bug allows a local user to escalate their privileges     on the system. (CVE-2023-0386)\n\n  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in rawv6_push_pending_frames in net/ipv6/raw.c in the network     subcomponent in the Linux kernel. This flaw causes the system to crash. (CVE-2023-0394)\n\n  - A memory corruption flaw was found in the Linux kernel's human interface device (HID) subsystem in how a     user inserts a malicious USB device. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their     privileges on the system. (CVE-2023-1073)\n\n  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Stream Control Transmission Protocol. This issue may     occur when a user starts a malicious networking service and someone connects to this service. This could     allow a local user to starve resources, causing a denial of service. (CVE-2023-1074)\n\n  - Use After Free vulnerability in Linux kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) allows Privilege     Escalation. The imperfect hash area can be updated while packets are traversing, which will cause a use-     after-free when 'tcf_exts_exec()' is called with the destroyed tcf_ext. A local attacker user can use this     vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root. This issue affects Linux Kernel: from 4.14 before git     commit ee059170b1f7e94e55fa6cadee544e176a6e59c2. (CVE-2023-1281)\n\n  - A use-after-free flaw was found in nfsd4_ssc_setup_dul in fs/nfsd/nfs4proc.c in the NFS filesystem in the     Linux Kernel. This issue could allow a local attacker to crash the system or it may lead to a kernel     information leak problem. (CVE-2023-1652)\n\n  - In the Linux kernel before 6.1.13, there is a double free in net/mpls/af_mpls.c upon an allocation failure     (for registering the sysctl table under a new location) during the renaming of a device.

host is prior to 1.0.2za. It is, therefore, affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the 1.0.2za advisory.\n\n  - ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a     buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings     which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not     a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own d2i functions (and other similar     parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will     additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for     applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array     by directly setting the data and length fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using     the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to     assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for     strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be     printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the     application without NUL terminating the data field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing     can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been     directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the     certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the     X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an     application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL     functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack).\n    It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive     plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).

activation-delay Firefox uses to     protect prompts and permission dialogs from attacks that exploit human response time delays. If a     malicious page elicited user clicks in precise locations immediately before navigating to a site with a     certificate error and made the renderer extremely busy at the same time, it could create a gap between     when the error page was loaded and when the display actually refreshed. With the right timing the elicited     clicks could land in that gap and  activate the button that overrides the certificate error for that site.\n    (CVE-2023-34414)\n\n  - When choosing a site-isolated process for a document loaded from a data: URL that was the result of a     redirect, Firefox would load that document in the same process as the site that issued the redirect.

This issue is due to an incorrect setting of the pixel array size, which     can lead to a crash and segmentation fault. (CVE-2021-3610)\n\n  - ImageMagick is free software delivered as a ready-to-run binary distribution or as source code that you     may use, copy, modify, and distribute in both open and proprietary applications. In affected versions and     in certain cases, Postscript files could be read and written when specifically excluded by a `module`     policy in `policy.xml`. ex. <policy domain=module rights=none pattern=PS />. The issue has been     resolved in ImageMagick 7.1.0-7 and in 6.9.12-22. Fortunately, in the wild, few users utilize the `module`     policy and instead use the `coder` policy that is also our workaround recommendation: <policy     domain=coder rights=none pattern={PS,EPI,EPS,EPSF,EPSI} />. (CVE-2021-39212)\n\n  - ImageMagick 7.1.0-27 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. (CVE-2022-28463)\n\n  - A vulnerability was found in ImageMagick, causing an outside the range of representable values of type     'unsigned char' at coders/psd.c, when crafted or untrusted input is processed. This leads to a negative     impact to application availability or other problems related to undefined behavior. (CVE-2022-32545)\n\n  - A vulnerability was found in ImageMagick, causing an outside the range of representable values of type     'unsigned long' at coders/pcl.c, when crafted or untrusted input is processed. This leads to a negative     impact to application availability or other problems related to undefined behavior. (CVE-2022-32546)\n\n  - In ImageMagick, there is load of misaligned address for type 'double', which requires 8 byte alignment and     for type 'float', which requires 4 byte alignment at MagickCore/property.c. Whenever crafted or untrusted     input is processed by ImageMagick, this causes a negative impact to application availability or other     problems related to undefined behavior. (CVE-2022-32547)\n\n  - A vulnerability was discovered in ImageMagick where a specially created SVG file loads itself and causes a     segmentation fault. This flaw allows a remote attacker to pass a specially crafted SVG file that leads to     a segmentation fault, generating many trash files in /tmp, resulting in a denial of service. When     ImageMagick crashes, it generates a lot of trash files. These trash files can be large if the SVG file     contains many render actions. In a denial of service attack, if a remote attacker uploads an SVG file of     size t, ImageMagick generates files of size 103*t. If an attacker uploads a 100M SVG, the server will     generate about 10G. (CVE-2023-1289)\n\n  - A heap-based buffer overflow issue was discovered in ImageMagick's ImportMultiSpectralQuantum() function     in MagickCore/quantum-import.c. An attacker could pass specially crafted file to convert, triggering an     out-of-bounds read error, allowing an application to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n    (CVE-2023-1906)\n\n  - A stack-based buffer overflow issue was found in ImageMagick's coders/tiff.c. This flaw allows an attacker     to trick the user into opening a specially crafted malicious tiff file, causing an application to crash,     resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2023-3195)\n\n  - A vulnerability was found in ImageMagick. This security flaw ouccers as an undefined behaviors of casting     double to size_t in svg, mvg and other coders (recurring bugs of CVE-2022-32546). (CVE-2023-34151)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.","exploit_available":true,"exploit_framework_canvas":false,"exploit_framework_core":false,"exploit_framework_d2_elliot":false,"exploit_framework_exploithub":false,"exploit_framework_metasploit":false,"exploitability_ease":"Exploits are available","exploited_by_malware":false,"exploited_by_nessus":false,"family":"Ubuntu Local Security Checks","family_id":58,"has_patch":true,"id":177934,"in_the_news":false,"name":"Ubuntu 16.04 ESM / 18.04 ESM / 20.04 LTS / 22.04 ESM / 23.04 : ImageMagick vulnerabilities (USN-6200-1)","patch_publication_date":"2023-07-04T00:00:00Z","modification_date":"2023-10-16T00:00:00Z","publication_date":"2023-07-04T00:00:00Z","risk_factor":"medium","see_also":["https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6200-1"],"solution":"Update the affected packages.","stig_severity":"I","synopsis":"The remote Ubuntu host is missing one or more security updates.","unsupported_by_vendor":false,"usn":"6200-1","version":"1.5","vuln_publication_date":"2020-12-07T00:00:00Z","xrefs":[{"type":"CVE","id":"2020-29599"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2021-20224"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2021-20241"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2021-20243"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2021-20244"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2021-20246"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2021-20309"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2021-20312"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2021-20313"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2021-3610"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2021-39212"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-28463"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-32545"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-32546"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2022-32547"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-1289"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-1906"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-3195"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-34151"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-3428"},{"type":"IAVB","id":"2020-B-0076-S"},{"type":"IAVB","id":"2021-B-0017-S"},{"type":"IAVB","id":"2022-B-0019-S"},{"type":"IAVB","id":"2022-B-0032-S"},{"type":"IAVB","id":"2023-B-0020-S"},{"type":"IAVB","id":"2023-B-0038-S"},{"type":"IAVB","id":"2023-B-0046-S"},{"type":"USN","id":"6200-1"}],"vpr":{"score":6.7,"drivers":{"age_of_vuln":{"lower_bound":731},"exploit_code_maturity":"PROOF_OF_CONCEPT","cvss_impact_score_predicted":false,"cvss3_impact_score":5.9,"threat_intensity_last28":"VERY_LOW","threat_sources_last28":["No recorded events"],"product_coverage":"LOW"},"updated":"2023-01-24T06:00:11Z"},"cve":["CVE-2020-29599","CVE-2021-20224","CVE-2021-20241","CVE-2021-20243","CVE-2021-20244","CVE-2021-20246","CVE-2021-20309","CVE-2021-20312","CVE-2021-20313","CVE-2021-3610","CVE-2021-39212","CVE-2022-28463","CVE-2022-32545","CVE-2022-32546","CVE-2022-32547","CVE-2023-1289","CVE-2023-1906","CVE-2023-3195","CVE-2023-34151","CVE-2023-3428"],"type":"local"},"port":{"port":0,"protocol":"TCP"},"scan":{"schedule_uuid":"template-dc6873ce-017a-0f45-e33f-82a067333cc80975a6cd4824e898","started_at":"2024-03-11T00:13:15Z","uuid":"6f80368c-99c3-73e3-611d-1a70529f1043"},"severity":"high","severity_id":3,"severity_default_id":2,"severity_modification_type":"NONE","first_found":"2023-09-18T19:51:48Z","last_found":"2024-03-11T01:52:21Z","state":"OPEN","indexed":"2024-03-11T02:03:28.204149Z","source":"AGENT"},{"asset":{"agent_uuid":"3750d349904a47d6aef0ef561b8b5f77","bios_uuid":"ec2758b4-b5f3-0bb2-f908-7649584bf9fa","device_type":"aws-ec2-instance","fqdn":"ip-172-20-0-1.us-east-2.compute.internal","hostname":"trh-agent","uuid":"5fcc163c-ce62-4abc-b655-5bab9ae23bf9","ipv4":"172.20.0.1","ipv6":"fe80::1","last_authenticated_results":"2024-03-11T01:52:21Z","mac_address":"02:42:45:f7:52:4a","operating_system":["Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS (Focal Fossa)"],"network_id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","tracked":true,"assetTags":[{"uuid":"e7cd429e-7660-4f1b-8c58-ffab0fedc01c","key":"testv","value":"123","added_by":"67368e82-4fe4-4447-ba6f-ea1f7120c52c","added_at":"2023-10-06T13:07:56.676Z"}]},"output":"\n  -

Every `named` instance configured to run as a recursive resolver maintains a cache database holding the     responses to the queries it has recently sent to authoritative servers. The size limit for that cache     database can be configured using the `max-cache-size` statement in the configuration file; it defaults to     90% of the total amount of memory available on the host. When the size of the cache reaches 7/8 of the     configured limit, a cache-cleaning algorithm starts to remove expired and/or least-recently used RRsets     from the cache, to keep memory use below the configured limit. It has been discovered that the     effectiveness of the cache-cleaning algorithm used in `named` can be severely diminished by querying the     resolver for specific RRsets in a certain order, effectively allowing the configured `max-cache-size`     limit to be significantly exceeded.

Apache Maven will follow repositories that are defined in a dependency's Project Object Model (pom) which     may be surprising to some users, resulting in potential risk if a malicious actor takes over that     repository or is able to insert themselves into a position to pretend to be that repository.

(CVE-2024-1549)\n\n  - A malicious website could have used a combination of exiting fullscreen mode and `requestPointerLock` to     cause the user's mouse to be re-positioned unexpectedly, which could have led to user confusion and     inadvertently granting permissions they did not intend to grant. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123,     Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1550)\n\n  - Set-Cookie response headers were being incorrectly honored in multipart HTTP responses. If an attacker     could control the Content-Type response header, as well as control part of the response body, they could     inject Set-Cookie response headers that would have been honored by the browser. This vulnerability affects     Firefox < 123, Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1551)\n\n  - Incorrect code generation could have led to unexpected numeric conversions and potential undefined     behavior.*Note:* This issue only affects 32-bit ARM devices. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123,     Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1552)\n\n  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 122, Firefox ESR 115.7, and Thunderbird 115.7. Some of these bugs     showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been     exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123, Firefox ESR < 115.8, and     Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1553)\n\n  - The `fetch()` API and navigation incorrectly shared the same cache, as the cache key did not include the     optional headers `fetch()` may contain. Under the correct circumstances, an attacker may have been able to     poison the local browser cache by priming it with a `fetch()` response controlled by the additional     headers. Upon navigation to the same URL, the user would see the cached response instead of the expected     response. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123. (CVE-2024-1554)\n\n  - When opening a website using the `firefox://` protocol handler, SameSite cookies were not properly     respected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123. (CVE-2024-1555)\n\n  - The incorrect object was checked for NULL in the built-in profiler, potentially leading to invalid memory     access and undefined behavior. *Note:* This issue only affects the application when the profiler is     running. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123. (CVE-2024-1556)\n\n  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 122. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we     presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This     vulnerability affects Firefox < 123. (CVE-2024-1557)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.","exploit_available":false,"exploit_framework_canvas":false,"exploit_framework_core":false,"exploit_framework_d2_elliot":false,"exploit_framework_exploithub":false,"exploit_framework_metasploit":false,"exploitability_ease":"No known exploits are available","exploited_by_malware":false,"exploited_by_nessus":false,"family":"Ubuntu Local Security Checks","family_id":58,"has_patch":true,"id":190884,"in_the_news":false,"name":"Ubuntu 20.04 LTS : Firefox vulnerabilities (USN-6649-1)","patch_publication_date":"2024-02-22T00:00:00Z","modification_date":"2024-02-23T00:00:00Z","publication_date":"2024-02-22T00:00:00Z","risk_factor":"high","see_also":["https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6649-1"],"solution":"Update the affected packages.","stig_severity":"I","synopsis":"The remote Ubuntu host is missing one or more security updates.","unsupported_by_vendor":false,"usn":"6649-1","version":"1.1","vuln_publication_date":"2024-02-20T00:00:00Z","xrefs":[{"type":"CVE","id":"2024-1546"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2024-1547"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2024-1548"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2024-1549"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2024-1550"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2024-1551"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2024-1552"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2024-1553"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2024-1554"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2024-1555"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2024-1556"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2024-1557"},{"type":"IAVA","id":"2024-A-0108"},{"type":"USN","id":"6649-1"}],"vpr":{"score":8.4,"drivers":{"age_of_vuln":{"lower_bound":8,"upper_bound":30},"exploit_code_maturity":"UNPROVEN","cvss_impact_score_predicted":false,"cvss3_impact_score":5.9,"threat_intensity_last28":"VERY_LOW","threat_sources_last28":["No recorded events"],"product_coverage":"LOW"},"updated":"2024-03-09T06:01:35Z"},"cve":["CVE-2024-1546","CVE-2024-1547","CVE-2024-1548","CVE-2024-1549","CVE-2024-1550","CVE-2024-1551","CVE-2024-1552","CVE-2024-1553","CVE-2024-1554","CVE-2024-1555","CVE-2024-1556","CVE-2024-1557"],"type":"local"},"port":{"port":0,"protocol":"TCP"},"scan":{"schedule_uuid":"template-dc6873ce-017a-0f45-e33f-82a067333cc80975a6cd4824e898","started_at":"2024-03-11T00:13:15Z","uuid":"6f80368c-99c3-73e3-611d-1a70529f1043"},"severity":"critical","severity_id":4,"severity_default_id":3,"severity_modification_type":"NONE","first_found":"2024-02-24T00:41:03Z","last_found":"2024-03-11T01:52:21Z","state":"OPEN","indexed":"2024-03-11T02:03:21.521459Z","source":"AGENT"},{"asset":{"agent_uuid":"3750d349904a47d6aef0ef561b8b5f77","bios_uuid":"ec2758b4-b5f3-0bb2-f908-7649584bf9fa","device_type":"aws-ec2-instance","fqdn":"ip-172-20-0-1.us-east-2.compute.internal","hostname":"trh-agent","uuid":"5fcc163c-ce62-4abc-b655-5bab9ae23bf9","ipv4":"172.20.0.1","ipv6":"fe80::1","last_authenticated_results":"2024-03-11T01:52:21Z","mac_address":"02:42:45:f7:52:4a","operating_system":["Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS (Focal Fossa)"],"network_id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","tracked":true,"assetTags":[{"uuid":"e7cd429e-7660-4f1b-8c58-ffab0fedc01c","key":"testv","value":"123","added_by":"67368e82-4fe4-4447-ba6f-ea1f7120c52c","added_at":"2023-10-06T13:07:56.676Z"}]},"output":"\n  -

An integer overflow issue was discovered in ImageMagick's ExportIndexQuantum() function in     MagickCore/quantum-export.c. Function calls to GetPixelIndex() could result in values outside the range of     representable for the 'unsigned char'. When ImageMagick processes a crafted pdf file, this could lead to     an undefined behaviour or a crash. (CVE-2021-20224)\n\n  - A flaw was found in ImageMagick in coders/jp2.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed     by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. The highest threat     from this vulnerability is to system availability. (CVE-2021-20241)\n\n  - A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/resize.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is     processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. The     highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. (CVE-2021-20243)\n\n  - A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/visual-effects.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file     that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero.\n    The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. (CVE-2021-20244)\n\n  - A flaw was found in ImageMagick in coders/webp.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed     by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. The highest threat     from this vulnerability is to system availability. (CVE-2021-20245)\n\n  - A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/resample.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is     processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. The     highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. (CVE-2021-20246)\n\n  - A flaw was found in ImageMagick in versions before 7.0.11 and before 6.9.12, where a division by zero in     WaveImage() of MagickCore/visual-effects.c may trigger undefined behavior via a crafted image file     submitted to an application using ImageMagick. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system     availability. (CVE-2021-20309)\n\n  - A flaw was found in ImageMagick in versions 7.0.11, where an integer overflow in WriteTHUMBNAILImage of     coders/thumbnail.c may trigger undefined behavior via a crafted image file that is submitted by an     attacker and processed by an application using ImageMagick. The highest threat from this vulnerability is     to system availability. (CVE-2021-20312)\n\n  - A flaw was found in ImageMagick in versions before 7.0.11. A potential cipher leak when the calculate     signatures in TransformSignature is possible. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data     confidentiality. (CVE-2021-20313)\n\n  - A vulnerability was found in ImageMagick-7.0.11-5, where executing a crafted file with the convert     command, ASAN detects memory leaks. (CVE-2021-3574)\n\n  - ImageMagick is free software delivered as a ready-to-run binary distribution or as source code that you     may use, copy, modify, and distribute in both open and proprietary applications. In affected versions and     in certain cases, Postscript files could be read and written when specifically excluded by a `module`     policy in `policy.xml`. ex. <policy domain=module rights=none pattern=PS />. The issue has been     resolved in ImageMagick 7.1.0-7 and in 6.9.12-22. Fortunately, in the wild, few users utilize the `module`     policy and instead use the `coder` policy that is also our workaround recommendation: <policy     domain=coder rights=none pattern={PS,EPI,EPS,EPSF,EPSI} />. (CVE-2021-39212)\n\n  - A flaw was found in ImageMagick. The vulnerability occurs due to improper use of open functions and leads     to a denial of service. This flaw allows an attacker to crash the system. (CVE-2021-4219)\n\n  - A heap-use-after-free flaw was found in ImageMagick's RelinquishDCMInfo() function of dcm.c file. This     vulnerability is triggered when an attacker passes a specially crafted DICOM image file to ImageMagick for     conversion, potentially leading to information disclosure and a denial of service. (CVE-2022-1114)\n\n  - ImageMagick 7.1.0-27 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. (CVE-2022-28463)\n\n  - A vulnerability was found in ImageMagick, causing an outside the range of representable values of type     'unsigned char' at coders/psd.c, when crafted or untrusted input is processed. This leads to a negative     impact to application availability or other problems related to undefined behavior. (CVE-2022-32545)\n\n  - A vulnerability was found in ImageMagick, causing an outside the range of representable values of type     'unsigned long' at coders/pcl.c, when crafted or untrusted input is processed. This leads to a negative     impact to application availability or other problems related to undefined behavior. (CVE-2022-32546)\n\n  - In ImageMagick, there is load of misaligned address for type 'double', which requires 8 byte alignment and     for type 'float', which requires 4 byte alignment at MagickCore/property.c. Whenever crafted or untrusted     input is processed by ImageMagick, this causes a negative impact to application availability or other     problems related to undefined behavior.

packages installed that are affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the USN-6610-1 advisory.\n\n  - An out of bounds write in ANGLE could have allowed an attacker to corrupt memory leading to a potentially     exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 122, Firefox ESR < 115.7, and Thunderbird < 115.7.\n    (CVE-2024-0741)\n\n  - It was possible for certain browser prompts and dialogs to be activated or dismissed unintentionally by     the user due to an incorrect timestamp used to prevent input after page load. This vulnerability affects     Firefox < 122, Firefox ESR < 115.7, and Thunderbird < 115.7. (CVE-2024-0742)\n\n  - An unchecked return value in TLS handshake code could have caused a potentially exploitable crash. This     vulnerability affects Firefox < 122. (CVE-2024-0743)\n\n  - In some circumstances, JIT compiled code could have dereferenced a wild pointer value. This could have led     to an exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 122. (CVE-2024-0744)\n\n  - The WebAudio `OscillatorNode` object was susceptible to a stack buffer overflow. This could have led to a     potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 122. (CVE-2024-0745)\n\n  - A Linux user opening the print preview dialog could have caused the browser to crash. This vulnerability     affects Firefox < 122, Firefox ESR < 115.7, and Thunderbird < 115.7. (CVE-2024-0746)\n\n  - When a parent page loaded a child in an iframe with `unsafe-inline`, the parent Content Security Policy     could have overridden the child Content Security Policy. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 122, Firefox     ESR < 115.7, and Thunderbird < 115.7. (CVE-2024-0747)\n\n  - A compromised content process could have updated the document URI. This could have allowed an attacker to     set an arbitrary URI in the address bar or history. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 122.\n    (CVE-2024-0748)\n\n  - A phishing site could have repurposed an `about:` dialog to show phishing content with an incorrect origin     in the address bar. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 122, Firefox ESR < 115.7, and Thunderbird <     115.7. (CVE-2024-0749)\n\n  - A bug in popup notifications delay calculation could have made it possible for an attacker to trick a user     into granting permissions. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 122, Firefox ESR < 115.7, and Thunderbird     < 115.7. (CVE-2024-0750)\n\n  - A malicious devtools extension could have been used to escalate privileges. This vulnerability affects     Firefox < 122, Firefox ESR < 115.7, and Thunderbird < 115.7. (CVE-2024-0751)\n\n  - In specific HSTS configurations an attacker could have bypassed HSTS on a subdomain. This vulnerability     affects Firefox < 122, Firefox ESR < 115.7, and Thunderbird < 115.7. (CVE-2024-0753)\n\n  - Some WASM source files could have caused a crash when loaded in devtools. This vulnerability affects     Firefox < 122. (CVE-2024-0754)\n\n  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 121, Firefox ESR 115.6, and Thunderbird 115.6. Some of these bugs     showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been     exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 122, Firefox ESR < 115.7, and     Thunderbird < 115.7.

This could be used to exhaust worker resources in the server, similar to the well known slow     loris attack pattern. This has been fixed in version 2.4.58, so that such connection are terminated     properly after the configured connection timeout. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.55     through 2.4.57.

Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and     resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On     connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.

Prior to versions 2.30.9, 2.31.8, 2.32.7, 2.33.8, 2.34.8, 2.35.8,     2.36.6, 2.37.7, 2.38.5, 2.39.3, and 2.40.1, by feeding specially crafted input to `git apply --reject`, a     path outside the working tree can be overwritten with partially controlled contents (corresponding to the     rejected hunk(s) from the given patch). A fix is available in versions 2.30.9, 2.31.8, 2.32.7, 2.33.8,     2.34.8, 2.35.8, 2.36.6, 2.37.7, 2.38.5, 2.39.3, and 2.40.1. As a workaround, avoid using `git apply` with     `--reject` when applying patches from an untrusted source. Use `git apply --stat` to inspect a patch     before applying; avoid applying one that create a conflict where a link corresponding to the `*.rej` file     exists. (CVE-2023-25652)\n\n  - In Git for Windows, the Windows port of Git, no localized messages are shipped with the installer. As a     consequence, Git is expected not to localize messages at all, and skips the gettext initialization.\n    However, due to a change in MINGW-packages, the `gettext()` function's implicit initialization no longer     uses the runtime prefix but uses the hard-coded path `C:\\mingw64\\share\\locale` to look for localized     messages. And since any authenticated user has the permission to create folders in `C:\\` (and since     `C:\\mingw64` does not typically exist), it is possible for low-privilege users to place fake messages in     that location where `git.exe` will pick them up in version 2.40.1. This vulnerability is relatively hard     to exploit and requires social engineering. For example, a legitimate message at the end of a clone could     be maliciously modified to ask the user to direct their web browser to a malicious website, and the user     might think that the message comes from Git and is legitimate. It does require local write access by the     attacker, though, which makes this attack vector less likely. Version 2.40.1 contains a patch for this     issue. Some workarounds are available. Do not work on a Windows machine with shared accounts, or     alternatively create a `C:\\mingw64` folder and leave it empty. Users who have administrative rights may     remove the permission to create folders in `C:\\`. (CVE-2023-25815)\n\n  - Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.30.9, 2.31.8, 2.32.7, 2.33.8, 2.34.8, 2.35.8,     2.36.6, 2.37.7, 2.38.5, 2.39.3, and 2.40.1, a specially crafted `.gitmodules` file with submodule URLs     that are longer than 1024 characters can used to exploit a bug in     `config.c::git_config_copy_or_rename_section_in_file()`. This bug can be used to inject arbitrary     configuration into a user's `$GIT_DIR/config` when attempting to remove the configuration section     associated with that submodule. When the attacker injects configuration values which specify executables     to run (such as `core.pager`, `core.editor`, `core.sshCommand`, etc.) this can lead to a remote code     execution. A fix A fix is available in versions 2.30.9, 2.31.8, 2.32.7, 2.33.8, 2.34.8, 2.35.8, 2.36.6,     2.37.7, 2.38.5, 2.39.3, and 2.40.1. As a workaround, avoid running `git submodule deinit` on untrusted     repositories or without prior inspection of any submodule sections in `$GIT_DIR/config`.

A vulnerability in input validation exists in curl <8.0 during communication using the TELNET protocol may     allow an attacker to pass on maliciously crafted user name and telnet options during server negotiation.\n    The lack of proper input scrubbing allows an attacker to send content or perform option negotiation     without the application's intent. This vulnerability could be exploited if an application allows user     input, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system. (CVE-2023-27533)\n\n  - A path traversal vulnerability exists in curl <8.0.0 SFTP implementation causes the tilde (~) character to     be wrongly replaced when used as a prefix in the first path element, in addition to its intended use as     the first element to indicate a path relative to the user's home directory. Attackers can exploit this     flaw to bypass filtering or execute arbitrary code by crafting a path like /~2/foo while accessing a     server with a specific user. (CVE-2023-27534)\n\n  - An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl <8.0.0 in the FTP connection reuse feature that     can result in wrong credentials being used during subsequent transfers. Previously created connections are     kept in a connection pool for reuse if they match the current setup. However, certain FTP settings such as     CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER, CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, and CURLOPT_USE_SSL were not     included in the configuration match checks, causing them to match too easily. This could lead to libcurl     using the wrong credentials when performing a transfer, potentially allowing unauthorized access to     sensitive information. (CVE-2023-27535)\n\n  - An authentication bypass vulnerability exists libcurl <8.0.0 in the connection reuse feature which can     reuse previously established connections with incorrect user permissions due to a failure to check for     changes in the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option. This vulnerability affects krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI     transfers and could potentially result in unauthorized access to sensitive information. The safest option     is to not reuse connections if the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option has been changed. (CVE-2023-27536)\n\n  - An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl v8.0.0 where it reuses a previously established     SSH connection despite the fact that an SSH option was modified, which should have prevented reuse.\n    libcurl maintains a pool of previously used connections to reuse them for subsequent transfers if the     configurations match. However, two SSH settings were omitted from the configuration check, allowing them     to match easily, potentially leading to the reuse of an inappropriate connection.

Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to     have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite     failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which     could lead to a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private     memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working     exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client,     this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the     server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.8 (Affected     since 3.0.0). (CVE-2022-4203)\n\n  - A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient     to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful     decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption.\n    The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS     connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An     attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send     trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number     of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be     able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zg (Affected since     1.0.2). (CVE-2022-4304)\n\n  - The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the name (e.g.\n    CERTIFICATE), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the name_out,     header and data arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data.\n    The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results     in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate     the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this     buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an     attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service     attack. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and     therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a     number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file()     which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the     caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations     include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL     asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.8 (Affected since     3.0.0). (CVE-2022-4450)\n\n  - The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is     primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may     also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a     new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the     BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid,     the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this     case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal     pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then     a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the     internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call     BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions     PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream, SMIME_write_ASN1,     SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7. Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include     i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream. The OpenSSL     cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected. Thanks to Octavio Galland (Max Planck     Institute for Security and Privacy). Thanks to Marcel Bhme (Max Planck Institute for Security and     Privacy). Fix developed by Viktor Dukhovni. Fix developed by Matt Caswell. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1t     (Affected since 1.1.1). (CVE-2023-0215)\n\n  - An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to load malformed PKCS7     data with the d2i_PKCS7(), d2i_PKCS7_bio() or d2i_PKCS7_fp() functions. The result of the dereference is     an application crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL     does not call this function however third party applications might call these functions on untrusted data.\n    Thanks to Marc Schnefeld. Fix developed by Tom Mrz. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.8 (Affected since 3.0.0).\n    (CVE-2023-0216)\n\n  - An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to check a malformed DSA     public key by the EVP_PKEY_public_check() function. This will most likely lead to an application crash.\n    This function can be called on public keys supplied from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker     to cause a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function but     applications might call the function if there are additional security requirements imposed by standards     such as FIPS 140-3. Thanks to Kurt Roeckx. Fix developed by Shane Lontis from Oracle. Fixed in OpenSSL     3.0.8 (Affected since 3.0.0). (CVE-2023-0217)\n\n  - There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName.\n    X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME     incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently     interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL     checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may     allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or     enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate     chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these     inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is     uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented     their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network. Thanks to David Benjamin (Google). Fix     developed by Hugo Landau. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1t (Affected since 1.1.1). (CVE-2023-0286)\n\n  - A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being verified on PKCS7 signed or     signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library     but the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the digest initialization will fail. There     is a missing check for the return value from the initialization function which later leads to invalid     usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash. The unavailability of an algorithm can be caused     by using FIPS enabled configuration of providers or more commonly by not loading the legacy provider.\n    PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also by the time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS     implementation in OpenSSL does not call these functions however third party applications would be affected     if they call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted data. Thanks to Hubert Kario (Red Hat).\n    Thanks to Dmitry Belyavsky (Red Hat). Fix developed by Tom Mrz. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.8 (Affected since     3.0.0).

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities:\n\n  - Apache Commons FileUpload before 1.5 does not limit the number of request parts to be processed resulting     in the possibility of an attacker triggering a DoS with a malicious upload or series of uploads. Note     that, like all of the file upload limits, the new configuration option (FileUploadBase#setFileCountMax) is     not enabled by default and must be explicitly configured. (CVE-2023-24998)\n\n  - High Jenkins 2.270 through 2.393 (both inclusive), LTS 2.277.1 through 2.375.3 (both inclusive) does not     escape the Jenkins version a plugin depends on when rendering the error message stating its     incompatibility with the current version of Jenkins in the plugin manager. This results in a stored cross-     site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to provide plugins to the configured     update sites and have this message shown by Jenkins instances. Exploitation does not require the     manipulated plugin to be installed. Jenkins 2.394, LTS 2.375.4, and LTS 2.387.1 escapes the Jenkins     version a plugin depends on when rendering the error message stating its incompatibility with the current     version of Jenkins. Due to how Jenkins community update sites serve plugin metadata based on the reported     Jenkins core version, it is unlikely that a reasonably up to date Jenkins instance shows the vulnerable     error message in the plugin manager at all. At least one of the following conditions needs to be met: The     Jenkins version used is older than about 13 months (before 2.333 or LTS 2.319.2 as of publication of this     advisory), as all more recent releases of Jenkins receive update site metadata that only includes     compatible versions of plugins. Jenkins has been downgraded from a newer version, and no updated update     site metadata has been requested since, so Jenkins will still display available plugins compatible with     the previously newer version of Jenkins. Custom update site URLs (i.e., not     https://updates.jenkins.io/update-center.json) are configured, and those update sites behave differently.\n    We expect that most of these will host a fairly small set of vetted plugins (e.g., an organization's     approved or internal plugins), preventing exploitation through their restrictive inclusion process.\n    Jenkins community update sites no longer publish plugin releases with invalid Jenkins core dependencies     since 2023-02-15. This prevents exploitation through those update sites even on versions of Jenkins older     than 13 months. Additionally, the Jenkins security team has confirmed that no plugin release with a core     dependency manipulated to exploit this vulnerability has ever been published by the Jenkins project.\n    (CVE-2023-27898)\n\n  - High Jenkins creates a temporary file when a plugin is uploaded from an administrator's computer. Jenkins     2.393 and earlier, LTS 2.375.3 and earlier creates this temporary file in the system temporary directory     with the default permissions for newly created files. If these permissions are overly permissive, they may     allow attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system to read and write the file before it is     installed in Jenkins, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability only affects     operating systems using a shared temporary directory for all users (typically Linux). Additionally, the     default permissions for newly created files generally only allows attackers to read the temporary file.\n    Jenkins 2.394, LTS 2.375.4, and LTS 2.387.1 creates the temporary file with more restrictive permissions.\n    As a workaround, you can set a different path as your default temporary directory using the Java system     property java.io.tmpdir, if you're concerned about this issue but unable to immediately update Jenkins.\n    (CVE-2023-27899)\n\n  - Medium Jenkins 2.393 and earlier, LTS 2.375.3 and earlier is affected by the Apache Commons FileUpload     library's vulnerability CVE-2023-24998. This library is used to process uploaded files via the Stapler web     framework (usually through StaplerRequest#getFile) and MultipartFormDataParser in Jenkins. This allows     attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending crafted requests to HTTP endpoints processing file     uploads. Jenkins 2.394, LTS 2.375.4, and LTS 2.387.1 limits the number of request parts to be processed to     1000. Specific endpoints receiving only simple form submissions have a lower limit. While the Apache     Commons FileUpload dependency has been updated previously in the 2.392 weekly release, the Jenkins-     specific changes in 2.394 are necessary for Jenkins to be protected. Some Jenkins forms can be very     complex, and these limits apply to all fields and not just fields representing uploaded files. As a     result, legitimate submissions of complex forms that include (possible) file uploads may be affected by     these limits. If that happens, these limits can be changed by setting the Java system properties     hudson.util.MultipartFormDataParser.FILEUPLOAD_MAX_FILES and     org.kohsuke.stapler.RequestImpl.FILEUPLOAD_MAX_FILES to a bigger value, or to -1 to completely disable     them. These releases of Jenkins also introduce additional Java system properties that can be set to     restrict request sizes: hudson.util.MultipartFormDataParser.FILEUPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE and     org.kohsuke.stapler.RequestImpl.FILEUPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE allow limiting the size (in bytes) of individual     fields that can be processed in one multipart/form-data request.\n    hudson.util.MultipartFormDataParser.FILEUPLOAD_MAX_SIZE and     org.kohsuke.stapler.RequestImpl.FILEUPLOAD_MAX_SIZE allow limiting the total request size (in bytes) that     can be processed in one multipart/form-data request. By default, Jenkins does not set these size limits.\n    Setting these system properties can offer additional protection, but comes at a greater risk of impacting     legitimate use (e.g., when uploading huge file parameters). (CVE-2023-27900, CVE-2023-27901)\n\n  - Medium Jenkins uses temporary directories adjacent to workspace directories, usually with the @tmp name     suffix, to store temporary files related to the build. In pipelines, these temporary directories are     adjacent to the current working directory when operating in a subdirectory of the automatically allocated     workspace. Jenkins-controlled processes, like SCMs, may store credentials in these directories. Jenkins     2.393 and earlier, LTS 2.375.3 and earlier shows these temporary directories when viewing job workspaces,     which allows attackers with Item/Workspace permission to access their contents. Jenkins 2.394, LTS     2.375.4, and LTS 2.387.1 does not list these temporary directories in job workspaces. As a workaround, do     not grant Item/Workspace permission to users who lack Item/Configure permission, if you're concerned about     this issue but unable to immediately update Jenkins. The Java system property     hudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.allowTmpEscape can be set to true to restore the previous behavior.\n    (CVE-2023-27902)\n\n  - Low When triggering a build from the Jenkins CLI, Jenkins creates a temporary file on the controller if a     file parameter is provided through the CLI's standard input. Jenkins 2.393 and earlier, LTS 2.375.3 and     earlier creates this temporary file in the default temporary directory with the default permissions for     newly created files. If these permissions are overly permissive, they may allow attackers with access to     the Jenkins controller file system to read and write the file before it is used in the build. This     vulnerability only affects operating systems using a shared temporary directory for all users (typically     Linux). Additionally, the default permissions for newly created files generally only allows attackers to     read the temporary file. Jenkins 2.394, LTS 2.375.4, and LTS 2.387.1 creates the temporary file with more     restrictive permissions. As a workaround, you can set a different path as your default temporary directory     using the Java system property java.io.tmpdir, if you're concerned about this issue but unable to     immediately update Jenkins. (CVE-2023-27903)\n\n  - Low Jenkins 2.393 and earlier, LTS 2.375.3 and earlier prints an error stack trace on agent-related pages     when agent connections are broken. This stack trace may contain information about Jenkins configuration     that is otherwise inaccessible to attackers. Jenkins 2.394, LTS 2.375.4, and LTS 2.387.1 does not display     error stack traces when agent connections are broken. (CVE-2023-27904)\n\n  - Medium update-center2 is the tool used to generate the Jenkins update sites hosted on updates.jenkins.io.\n    While it is designed for use by the Jenkins project for this purpose, others may be using it to operate     their own self-hosted update sites. update-center2 3.13 and 3.14 renders the required Jenkins core version     on plugin download index pages (pages like this). This version is taken from plugin metadata without being     sanitized. This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able     to provide a plugin for hosting. The following preconditions must both be satisfied for this to be     exploitable in a self-hosted update-center2: The generation of download pages needs to be enabled (i.e.,     the --download-links-directory argument needs to be set). A custom download page template must be used     (--index-template-url argument), and the template used must not prevent JavaScript execution through     Content-Security-Policy. The default template prevents exploitation by declaring a restrictive Content-     Security-Policy. update-center2 3.15 filters out plugin releases with invalid Jenkins core dependencies.\n    Administrators hosting their own update sites using update-center2 or a fork thereof are advised to update     it, or integrate the commit 091ef999. This change has been deployed to Jenkins community update sites on     2023-02-15. The Jenkins project has distributed a single plugin release, that exploited this vulnerability     in a harmless way to demonstrate the issue, for two hours on 2023-01-16. No other plugin releases that     exploit this vulnerability have been published. (CVE-2023-27905)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version

NFSD tracks the number of pages held by each NFSD thread by combining the receive and send     buffers of a remote procedure call (RPC) into a single array of pages. A client can force the send buffer     to shrink by sending an RPC message over TCP with garbage data added at the end of the message.

This functionality is also exposed to `git archive` via the `export-subst`     gitattribute. When processing the padding operators, there is a integer overflow in     `pretty.c::format_and_pad_commit()` where a `size_t` is stored improperly as an `int`, and then added as     an offset to a `memcpy()`. This overflow can be triggered directly by a user running a command which     invokes the commit formatting machinery (e.g., `git log --format=...`). It may also be triggered     indirectly through git archive via the export-subst mechanism, which expands format specifiers inside of     files within the repository during a git archive. This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap     writes, which may result in arbitrary code execution. The problem has been patched in the versions     published on 2023-01-17, going back to v2.30.7. Users are advised to upgrade. Users who are unable to     upgrade should disable `git archive` in untrusted repositories. If you expose git archive via `git     daemon`, disable it by running `git config --global daemon.uploadArch false`. (CVE-2022-41903)\n\n  - Git is distributed revision control system. gitattributes are a mechanism to allow defining attributes for     paths. These attributes can be defined by adding a `.gitattributes` file to the repository, which contains     a set of file patterns and the attributes that should be set for paths matching this pattern. When parsing     gitattributes, multiple integer overflows can occur when there is a huge number of path patterns, a huge     number of attributes for a single pattern, or when the declared attribute names are huge. These overflows     can be triggered via a crafted `.gitattributes` file that may be part of the commit history. Git silently     splits lines longer than 2KB when parsing gitattributes from a file, but not when parsing them from the     index. Consequentially, the failure mode depends on whether the file exists in the working tree, the index     or both. This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap reads and writes, which may result in remote     code execution. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2023-01-17, going back to     v2.30.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

packages installed that are affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the USN-6404-1 advisory.\n\n  - A compromised content process could have provided malicious data in a `PathRecording` resulting in an out-     of-bounds write, leading to a potentially exploitable crash in a privileged process. This vulnerability     affects Firefox < 118, Firefox ESR < 115.3, and Thunderbird < 115.3. (CVE-2023-5169)\n\n  - In canvas rendering, a compromised content process could have caused a surface to change unexpectedly,     leading to a memory leak of a privileged process. This memory leak could be used to effect a sandbox     escape if the correct data was leaked. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 118. (CVE-2023-5170)\n\n  - During Ion compilation, a Garbage Collection could have resulted in a use-after-free condition, allowing     an attacker to write two NUL bytes, and cause a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects     Firefox < 118, Firefox ESR < 115.3, and Thunderbird < 115.3. (CVE-2023-5171)\n\n  - A hashtable in the Ion Engine could have been mutated while there was a live interior reference, leading     to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 118.\n    (CVE-2023-5172)\n\n  - In a non-standard configuration of Firefox, an integer overflow could have occurred based on network     traffic (possibly under influence of a local unprivileged webpage), leading to an out-of-bounds write to     privileged process memory. *This bug only affects Firefox if a non-standard preference allowing non-HTTPS     Alternate Services (`network.http.altsvc.oe`) is enabled.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 118.\n    (CVE-2023-5173)\n\n  - During process shutdown, it was possible that an `ImageBitmap` was created that would later be used after     being freed from a different codepath, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability     affects Firefox < 118. (CVE-2023-5175)\n\n  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 117, Firefox ESR 115.2, and Thunderbird 115.2. Some of these bugs     showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been     exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 118, Firefox ESR < 115.3, and     Thunderbird < 115.3. (CVE-2023-5176)\n\n  - Heap buffer overflow in vp8 encoding in libvpx in Google Chrome prior to 117.0.5938.132 and libvpx 1.13.1     allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium     security severity: High) (CVE-2023-5217)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.","exploit_available":true,"exploit_framework_canvas":false,"exploit_framework_core":false,"exploit_framework_d2_elliot":false,"exploit_framework_exploithub":false,"exploit_framework_metasploit":false,"exploitability_ease":"Exploits are available","exploited_by_malware":false,"exploited_by_nessus":false,"family":"Ubuntu Local Security Checks","family_id":58,"has_patch":true,"id":182431,"in_the_news":false,"name":"Ubuntu 20.04 LTS : Firefox vulnerabilities (USN-6404-1)","patch_publication_date":"2023-10-03T00:00:00Z","modification_date":"2023-11-01T00:00:00Z","publication_date":"2023-10-03T00:00:00Z","risk_factor":"critical","see_also":["https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6404-1"],"solution":"Update the affected packages.","stig_severity":"I","synopsis":"The remote Ubuntu host is missing one or more security updates.","unsupported_by_vendor":false,"usn":"6404-1","version":"1.4","vuln_publication_date":"2023-09-26T00:00:00Z","xrefs":[{"type":"CISA-KNOWN-EXPLOITED","id":"2023/10/23"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-5169"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-5170"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-5171"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-5172"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-5173"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-5175"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-5176"},{"type":"CVE","id":"2023-5217"},{"type":"IAVA","id":"2023-A-0507-S"},{"type":"IAVA","id":"2023-A-0522-S"},{"type":"USN","id":"6404-1"}],"vpr":{"score":9.2,"drivers":{"age_of_vuln":{"lower_bound":61,"upper_bound":180},"exploit_code_maturity":"FUNCTIONAL","cvss_impact_score_predicted":false,"cvss3_impact_score":5.9,"threat_intensity_last28":"VERY_LOW","threat_recency":{"lower_bound":31,"upper_bound":120},"threat_sources_last28":["No recorded events"],"product_coverage":"VERY_HIGH"},"updated":"2024-02-02T06:01:23Z"},"cve":["CVE-2023-5169","CVE-2023-5170","CVE-2023-5171","CVE-2023-5172","CVE-2023-5173","CVE-2023-5175","CVE-2023-5176","CVE-2023-5217"],"type":"local"},"port":{"port":0,"protocol":"TCP"},"scan":{"schedule_uuid":"template-dc6873ce-017a-0f45-e33f-82a067333cc80975a6cd4824e898","started_at":"2024-03-11T00:13:15Z","uuid":"6f80368c-99c3-73e3-611d-1a70529f1043"},"severity":"critical","severity_id":4,"severity_default_id":4,"severity_modification_type":"NONE","first_found":"2023-10-05T20:18:25Z","last_found":"2024-03-11T01:52:21Z","state":"OPEN","indexed":"2024-03-11T02:03:27.080418Z","source":"AGENT"},{"asset":{"agent_uuid":"3750d349904a47d6aef0ef561b8b5f77","bios_uuid":"ec2758b4-b5f3-0bb2-f908-7649584bf9fa","device_type":"aws-ec2-instance","fqdn":"ip-172-20-0-1.us-east-2.compute.internal","hostname":"trh-agent","uuid":"5fcc163c-ce62-4abc-b655-5bab9ae23bf9","ipv4":"172.20.0.1","ipv6":"fe80::1","last_authenticated_results":"2024-03-11T01:52:21Z","mac_address":"02:42:45:f7:52:4a","operating_system":["Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS (Focal Fossa)"],"network_id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","tracked":true,"assetTags":[{"uuid":"e7cd429e-7660-4f1b-8c58-ffab0fedc01c","key":"testv","value":"123","added_by":"67368e82-4fe4-4447-ba6f-ea1f7120c52c","added_at":"2023-10-06T13:07:56.676Z"}]},"output":"\n  -

Guests can trigger NIC interface reset/abort/crash via netback It is possible for a guest to trigger a NIC     interface reset/abort/crash in a Linux based network backend by sending certain kinds of packets. It     appears to be an (unwritten?) assumption in the rest of the Linux network stack that packet protocol     headers are all contained within the linear section of the SKB and some NICs behave badly if this is not     the case. This has been reported to occur with Cisco (enic) and Broadcom NetXtrem II BCM5780 (bnx2x)     though it may be an issue with other NICs/drivers as well. In case the frontend is sending requests with     split headers, netback will forward those violating above mentioned assumption to the networking core,     resulting in said misbehavior. (CVE-2022-3643)\n\n  - There are use-after-free vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel's net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c's l2cap_connect     and l2cap_le_connect_req functions which may allow code execution and leaking kernel memory (respectively)     remotely via Bluetooth.

(CVE-2022-47940)\n\n  - A use-after-free flaw was found in qdisc_graft in net/sched/sch_api.c in the Linux Kernel due to a race     problem. This flaw leads to a denial of service issue. If patch ebda44da44f6 (net: sched: fix race     condition in qdisc_graft()) not applied yet, then kernel could be affected.
