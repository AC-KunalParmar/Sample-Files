Affected versions of moment were found to use an inefficient parsing algorithm. Specifically using string-to-date parsing in moment (more specifically rfc2822 parsing, which is tried by default) has quadratic (N^2) complexity on specific inputs. Users may notice a noticeable slowdown is observed with inputs above 10k characters. Users who pass user-provided strings without sanity length checks to moment constructor are vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks. The problem is patched in 2.29.4, the patch can be applied to all affected versions with minimal tweaking. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should consider limiting date lengths accepted from user input.","project":"TRH-all_test","product":"TRH-all","cvss3Attributes":{"attackVector":"NETWORK","attackComplexity":"LOW","userInteraction":"NONE","privilegesRequired":"NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","confidentialityImpact":"NONE","integrityImpact":"NONE","availabilityImpact":"HIGH"},"library":{"keyUuid":"a76df37c-bfe4-4c65-bc84-1cea47667a48","filename":"moment-2.19.0.min.js","type":"JAVA_SCRIPT_LIBRARY","description":"Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates","sha1":"6b7e10e346c848b9e43414b7d5ef7d068bd26b80","name":"moment.js","artifactId":"moment-2.19.0.min.js","version":"2.19.0","groupId":"moment.js","architecture":"","languageVersion":""},"topFix":{"vulnerability":"CVE-2022-31129","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://github.com/moment/moment/security/advisories/GHSA-wc69-rhjr-hc9g","fixResolution":"Upgrade to version moment - 2.29.4","date":"2022-07-06 18:15:00","message":"Upgrade to version"},"locations":[{"matchType":"Exact Match","path":"/home/ubuntu/whitesource/railsgoat/app/assets/javascripts/moment.min.js"}],"productToken":"e7a19a2a645a4ddfb04f59c1d5ffd1a7e59f801bfbdb411dab35cd77150f653d","projectToken":"831f4c2e5d484a20b279aaeaf0f220e315810aec2f5b4788a6632de886d0f493"},{"name":"CVE-2017-18214","type":"CVE","severity":"high","score":"5.0","cvss3_severity":"HIGH","cvss3_score":"7.5","publishDate":"2018-03-04","lastUpdatedDate":"2022-02-14","scoreMetadataVector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","url":"https://www.mend.io/vulnerability-database/CVE-2017-18214","description":"The moment module before 2.19.3 for Node.js is prone to a regular expression denial of service via a crafted date string, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-4055.","project":"TRH-all_test","product":"TRH-all","cvss3Attributes":{"attackVector":"NETWORK","attackComplexity":"LOW","userInteraction":"NONE","privilegesRequired":"NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","confidentialityImpact":"NONE","integrityImpact":"NONE","availabilityImpact":"HIGH"},"library":{"keyUuid":"a76df37c-bfe4-4c65-bc84-1cea47667a48","filename":"moment-2.19.0.min.js","type":"JAVA_SCRIPT_LIBRARY","description":"Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates","sha1":"6b7e10e346c848b9e43414b7d5ef7d068bd26b80","name":"moment.js","artifactId":"moment-2.19.0.min.js","version":"2.19.0","groupId":"moment.js","architecture":"","languageVersion":""},"topFix":{"vulnerability":"CVE-2017-18214","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-446m-mv8f-q348","fixResolution":"Upgrade to version moment - 2.19.3","date":"2018-03-04 21:00:00","message":"Upgrade to version"},"allFixes":[{"vulnerability":"CVE-2017-18214","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-446m-mv8f-q348","fixResolution":"Upgrade to version moment - 2.19.3","date":"2018-03-04 21:00:00","message":"Upgrade to version"},{"vulnerability":"CVE-2017-18214","type":"CHANGE_FILES","origin":"GITHUB_COMMIT","url":"https://github.com/moment/moment/commit/69ed9d44957fa6ab12b73d2ae29d286a857b80eb","fixResolution":"Replace or update the following files: regex.js, moment-with-locales.js, moment.js","date":"2017-11-29 00:00:00","message":"[bugfix] Fix for ReDOS vulnerability (see #4163) (#4326)\n\n* Limiting regex match to 256 chars, fixing #4163\r\n\r\n* Limiting regex match to 256 chars, fixing #4163\r\n\r\n* Also limiting numbers to fix #4163"},{"vulnerability":"CVE-2017-18214","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"NODE_SECURITY_ADVISORY","url":"https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/532","fixResolution":"Update to version 2.19.3","date":"2017-11-27 17:56:00","message":"Regular Expression Denial of Service"}],"locations":[{"matchType":"Exact Match","path":"/home/ubuntu/whitesource/railsgoat/app/assets/javascripts/moment.min.js"}],"productToken":"e7a19a2a645a4ddfb04f59c1d5ffd1a7e59f801bfbdb411dab35cd77150f653d","projectToken":"831f4c2e5d484a20b279aaeaf0f220e315810aec2f5b4788a6632de886d0f493"},{"name":"CVE-2022-24785","type":"CVE","severity":"high","score":"5.0","cvss3_severity":"HIGH","cvss3_score":"7.5","publishDate":"2022-04-04","lastUpdatedDate":"2023-02-16","scoreMetadataVector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","url":"https://www.mend.io/vulnerability-database/CVE-2022-24785","description":"Moment.js is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.

Versions prior to 0.36.1, as well as those prior to 1.2.10 when used with the Ruby data source tzinfo-data, are vulnerable to relative path traversal. With the Ruby data source, time zones are defined in Ruby files. There is one file per time zone. Time zone files are loaded with `require` on demand. In the affected versions, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` fails to validate time zone identifiers correctly, allowing a new line character within the identifier. With Ruby version 1.9.3 and later, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` can be made to load unintended files with `require`, executing them within the Ruby process. Versions 0.3.61 and 1.2.10 include fixes to correctly validate time zone identifiers. Versions 2.0.0 and later are not vulnerable. Version 0.3.61 can still load arbitrary files from the Ruby load path if their name follows the rules for a valid time zone identifier and the file has a prefix of `tzinfo/definition` within a directory in the load path. Applications should ensure that untrusted files are not placed in a directory on the load path. As a workaround, the time zone identifier can be validated before passing to `TZInfo::Timezone.get` by ensuring it matches the regular expression `\\A[A-Za-z0-9+\\-_]+(?:\\/[A-Za-z0-9+\\-_]+)*\\z`.","project":"TRH-all_test","product":"TRH-all","cvss3Attributes":{"attackVector":"NETWORK","attackComplexity":"HIGH","userInteraction":"NONE","privilegesRequired":"NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","confidentialityImpact":"HIGH","integrityImpact":"HIGH","availabilityImpact":"HIGH"},"library":{"keyUuid":"61023864-1453-49e1-9b10-29e8a8a053fd","filename":"tzinfo-1.2.5.gem","type":"RUBY_GEM","description":"TZInfo provides daylight savings aware transformations between times in different time zones.","sha1":"c63e819a4ef646956bef31acec7d39ddccaff35c","name":"tzinfo","artifactId":"tzinfo-1.2.5.gem","version":"1.2.5","groupId":"tzinfo","architecture":"","languageVersion":""},"topFix":{"vulnerability":"CVE-2022-31163","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://github.com/tzinfo/tzinfo/security/advisories/GHSA-5cm2-9h8c-rvfx","fixResolution":"Upgrade to version tzinfo -

Due to the difference in the attribute parser of Dompdf and php-svg-lib, an attacker can still call arbitrary URLs with arbitrary protocols. Dompdf parses the href attribute of `image` tags and respects `xlink:href` even if `href` is specified. However, php-svg-lib, which is later used to parse the svg file, parses the href attribute. Since `href` is respected if both `xlink:href` and `href` is specified, it's possible to bypass the protection on the Dompdf side by providing an empty `xlink:href` attribute. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to call arbitrary URLs with arbitrary protocols if they provide an SVG file to the Dompdf. In PHP versions before 8.0.0, it leads to arbitrary unserialize, which will lead, at the very least, to arbitrary file deletion and might lead to remote code execution, depending on available classes.

In other words, while this is not technically a vulnerability in Laravel, this default configuration is very likely to lead to practically identical identical vulnerabilities in Laravel projects that implement multi-tenant applications.","project":"TRH-all_test","product":"TRH-all","cvss3Attributes":{"attackVector":"NETWORK","attackComplexity":"LOW","userInteraction":"REQUIRED","privilegesRequired":"NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","confidentialityImpact":"HIGH","integrityImpact":"HIGH","availabilityImpact":"NONE"},"library":{"keyUuid":"47d3cf14-fa4d-4935-9f1b-50fc964e8ae1","filename":"sentry/sentry-laravel-2.14.2","type":"PHP_PACKAGE","description":"Laravel SDK for Sentry (https://sentry.io)","sha1":"4fdecc9dc9bf7b8ba2bdd6cb8e12a3123d8c6b3f","name":"sentry/sentry-laravel","artifactId":"sentry/sentry-laravel","version":"2.14.2","groupId":"sentry/sentry-laravel","architecture":"","languageVersion":""},"topFix":{"vulnerability":"CVE-2021-36804","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-246r-r2wf-frhx","fixResolution":"Upgrade to version v8.4.4","date":"2021-08-04 23:15:00","message":"Upgrade to version"},"locations":[{"matchType":"Exact Match"}],"productToken":"e7a19a2a645a4ddfb04f59c1d5ffd1a7e59f801bfbdb411dab35cd77150f653d","projectToken":"831f4c2e5d484a20b279aaeaf0f220e315810aec2f5b4788a6632de886d0f493"},{"name":"CVE-2021-3874","type":"CVE","severity":"medium","score":"4.0","cvss3_severity":"MEDIUM","cvss3_score":"6.5","publishDate":"2021-10-15","lastUpdatedDate":"2021-10-20","scoreMetadataVector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","url":"https://www.mend.io/vulnerability-database/CVE-2021-3874","description":"bookstack is vulnerable to Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","project":"TRH-all_test","product":"TRH-all","cvss3Attributes":{"attackVector":"NETWORK","attackComplexity":"LOW","userInteraction":"NONE","privilegesRequired":"LOW","scope":"UNCHANGED","confidentialityImpact":"HIGH","integrityImpact":"NONE","availabilityImpact":"NONE"},"library":{"keyUuid":"47d3cf14-fa4d-4935-9f1b-50fc964e8ae1","filename":"sentry/sentry-laravel-2.14.2","type":"PHP_PACKAGE","description":"Laravel SDK for Sentry (https://sentry.io)","sha1":"4fdecc9dc9bf7b8ba2bdd6cb8e12a3123d8c6b3f","name":"sentry/sentry-laravel","artifactId":"sentry/sentry-laravel","version":"2.14.2","groupId":"sentry/sentry-laravel","architecture":"","languageVersion":""},"topFix":{"vulnerability":"CVE-2021-3874","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3874","fixResolution":"Upgrade to version v21.08.5","date":"2021-10-15 14:15:00","message":"Upgrade to version"},"locations":[{"matchType":"Exact Match"}],"productToken":"e7a19a2a645a4ddfb04f59c1d5ffd1a7e59f801bfbdb411dab35cd77150f653d","projectToken":"831f4c2e5d484a20b279aaeaf0f220e315810aec2f5b4788a6632de886d0f493"},{"name":"CVE-2023-24065","type":"CVE","severity":"medium","score":"5.4","cvss3_severity":"MEDIUM","cvss3_score":"5.4","publishDate":"2023-01-29","lastUpdatedDate":"2023-02-07","scoreMetadataVector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","url":"https://www.mend.io/vulnerability-database/CVE-2023-24065","description":"NOSH 4a5cfdb allows stored XSS via the create user page.

In `@babel/traverse` prior to versions 7.23.2 and 8.0.0-alpha.4 and all versions of `babel-traverse`, using Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation, when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods. Known affected plugins are `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`; `@babel/preset-env` when using its `useBuiltIns` option; and any \"polyfill provider\" plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`, such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`. No other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace are impacted, but third-party plugins might be. Users that only compile trusted code are not impacted. The vulnerability has been fixed in `@babel/traverse@7.23.2` and `@babel/traverse@8.0.0-alpha.4`. Those who cannot upgrade `@babel/traverse` and are using one of the affected packages mentioned above should upgrade them to their latest version to avoid triggering the vulnerable code path in affected `@babel/traverse` versions: `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` v7.23.2, `@babel/preset-env` v7.23.2, `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` v0.4.3, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2` v0.4.6, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3` v0.8.5, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims` v0.10.0, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator` v0.5.3.","project":"TRH-all_test","product":"TRH-all","cvss3Attributes":{"attackVector":"LOCAL","attackComplexity":"LOW","userInteraction":"NONE","privilegesRequired":"LOW","scope":"CHANGED","confidentialityImpact":"HIGH","integrityImpact":"HIGH","availabilityImpact":"HIGH"},"library":{"keyUuid":"16b10729-968b-4419-8649-e39b9e117e9d","filename":"traverse-7.18.11.tgz","type":"NODE_PACKAGED_MODULE","description":"The Babel Traverse module maintains the overall tree state, and is responsible for replacing, removing, and adding nodes","sha1":"3d51f2afbd83ecf9912bcbb5c4d94e3d2ddaa16f","name":"@babel/traverse","artifactId":"traverse-7.18.11.tgz","version":"7.18.11","groupId":"@babel/traverse","architecture":"","languageVersion":""},"topFix":{"vulnerability":"CVE-2023-45133","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://github.com/babel/babel/security/advisories/GHSA-67hx-6x53-jw92","fixResolution":"Upgrade to version @babel/traverse - 7.23.2","date":"2023-10-12 17:15:10","message":"Upgrade to version"},"locations":[{"matchType":"Exact Match","dependencyFile":"/home/ubuntu/whitesource/monica/package.json"}],"productToken":"e7a19a2a645a4ddfb04f59c1d5ffd1a7e59f801bfbdb411dab35cd77150f653d","projectToken":"831f4c2e5d484a20b279aaeaf0f220e315810aec2f5b4788a6632de886d0f493"},{"name":"CVE-2019-5419","type":"CVE","severity":"high","score":"7.8","cvss3_severity":"HIGH","cvss3_score":"7.5","publishDate":"2019-03-27","lastUpdatedDate":"2020-10-16","scoreMetadataVector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","url":"https://www.mend.io/vulnerability-database/CVE-2019-5419","description":"There is a possible denial of service vulnerability in Action View (Rails) <5.2.2.1, <5.1.6.2, <5.0.7.2, <4.2.11.1 where specially crafted accept headers can cause action view to consume 100% cpu and make the server unresponsive.","project":"TRH-all_test","product":"TRH-all","cvss3Attributes":{"attackVector":"NETWORK","attackComplexity":"LOW","userInteraction":"NONE","privilegesRequired":"NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","confidentialityImpact":"NONE","integrityImpact":"NONE","availabilityImpact":"HIGH"},"library":{"keyUuid":"89b52c6a-e2fb-4bad-b62c-e9aa87417654","filename":"rails-5.2.2.gem","type":"RUBY_GEM","description":"Ruby on Rails is a full-stack web framework optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity.

The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including versions 1.0.1 and 2.2.1 does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse` should restrict parsing of `__proto__` keys when parsing JSON strings to objects. As a point of reference, the `JSON.parse` method included in JavaScript ignores `__proto__` keys. Simply changing `JSON5.parse` to `JSON.parse` in the examples above mitigates this vulnerability. This vulnerability is patched in json5 versions 1.0.2, 2.2.2, and later.","project":"TRH-all_test","product":"TRH-all","cvss3Attributes":{"attackVector":"NETWORK","attackComplexity":"LOW","userInteraction":"NONE","privilegesRequired":"LOW","scope":"UNCHANGED","confidentialityImpact":"HIGH","integrityImpact":"HIGH","availabilityImpact":"HIGH"},"library":{"keyUuid":"40aaba56-77cc-43b4-96ac-c0365374688a","filename":"json5-2.2.1.tgz","type":"NODE_PACKAGED_MODULE","description":"JSON for humans.","sha1":"655d50ed1e6f95ad1a3caababd2b0efda10b395c","name":"json5","artifactId":"json5-2.2.1.tgz","version":"2.2.1","groupId":"json5","architecture":"","languageVersion":""},"topFix":{"vulnerability":"CVE-2022-46175","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-46175","fixResolution":"Upgrade to version json5 - 2.2.2","date":"2022-12-24 04:15:09","message":"Upgrade to version"},"locations":[{"matchType":"Exact Match","dependencyFile":"/home/ubuntu/whitesource/monica/package.json"}],"productToken":"e7a19a2a645a4ddfb04f59c1d5ffd1a7e59f801bfbdb411dab35cd77150f653d","projectToken":"831f4c2e5d484a20b279aaeaf0f220e315810aec2f5b4788a6632de886d0f493"},{"name":"CVE-2022-23515","type":"CVE","severity":"medium","score":"6.1","cvss3_severity":"MEDIUM","cvss3_score":"6.1","publishDate":"2022-12-14","lastUpdatedDate":"2023-09-13","scoreMetadataVector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","url":"https://www.mend.io/vulnerability-database/CVE-2022-23515","description":"Loofah is a general library for manipulating and transforming HTML/XML documents and fragments, built on top of Nokogiri.

For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request.

The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.","project":"TRH-all_test","product":"TRH-all","cvss3Attributes":{"attackVector":"NETWORK","attackComplexity":"LOW","userInteraction":"NONE","privilegesRequired":"NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","confidentialityImpact":"NONE","integrityImpact":"NONE","availabilityImpact":"HIGH"},"library":{"keyUuid":"dc24a85f-23cc-4143-8cac-246efbf0efbc","filename":"puma-4.3.5.gem","type":"RUBY_GEM","description":"Puma is a simple, fast, threaded, and highly concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications.

Prior to versions 5.5.1 and 4.3.9, using `puma` with a proxy which forwards HTTP header values which contain the LF character could allow HTTP request smugggling. A client could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client. The only proxy which has this behavior, as far as the Puma team is aware of, is Apache Traffic Server. If the proxy uses persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests, and when processing the second request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another request for a different client, the second response from the first client will be sent to the second client. This vulnerability was patched in Puma 5.5.1 and 4.3.9.

The <!> character is 0x21. So `qdtext`\ncan be written either positively as:\n\n    qdtext        = [\\t !\\x23-\\x7E\\x80-\\xFF]\n\nor negatively, as:\n\n    qdtext        = [^\\x00-\\x08\\x0A-\\x1F\\x7F\"]\n\nWe use the negative definition here. The other alternative in the\n`quoted-string` pattern is:\n\n    quoted-pair   = \\\\[\\x00-\\x7F]\n\nThe problem is that the set of bytes matched by `qdtext` includes <\\>,\nand intersects with the second element of `quoted-pair`. That means the\nsequence \\c can be matched as either two `qdtext` bytes, or as a single\n`quoted-pair`. When the regex engine fails to find a trailing <\"> to\nclose the string, it back-tracks and tries every alternate parse for the\nstring, which doubles with each pair of bytes in the input.\n\nTo fix the ReDoS flaw we need to rewrite the repeating pattern so that\nnone of its alternate branches can match the same text. For example, we\ncould try dividing the set of bytes [\\x00-\\xFF] into those that must not\nfollow a <\\>, those that may follow a <\\>, and those that must be\npreceded by <\\>, and thereby construct a pattern of the form:\n\n    (A|\\?B|\\C)*\n\nwhere A, B and C have no characters in common. In our case the three\nbranch patterns would be:\n\n    A   =   qdtext - CHAR   =   [\\x80-\\xFF]\n    B   =   qdtext & CHAR   =   [\\t !\\x23-\\x7E]\n    C   =   CHAR - qdtext   =   [\\x00-\\x08\\x0A-\\x1F\\x7F\"]\n\nThese sets do not intersect, and notice <\"> appears in set C so must be\npreceded by <\\>. But we still have a problem: <\\> (0x5C) and all the\nalphabetic characters are in set B, so the pattern \\?B can match all\nthese:\n\n    c\n    \\\n    \\c\n\nSo the sequence \\c\\c\\c... still produces exponential back-tracking. It\nalso fails to parse input like this correctly:\n\n    Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: a; b=\"c\\\", d\"\n\nBecause the grammar allows a single backslash to appear by itself, this\nis arguably a syntax error where the parameter `b` has value `c\\` and\nthen a new extension `d` begins with a <\"> appearing where it should\nnot.\n\nSo the core problem is with the grammar itself: `qdtext` matches a\nsingle backslash <\\>, and `quoted-pair` matches a pair <\\\\>.

It\ncan be exploited by sending an opening WebSocket handshake to a server\ncontaining a header of the form:\n\n    Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: a;b=\"\\c\\c\\c\\c\\c\\c\\c\\c\\c\\c ...\n\ni.e. a header containing an unclosed string parameter value whose\ncontent is a repeating two-byte sequence of a backslash and some other\ncharacter. The parser takes exponential time to reject this header as\ninvalid, and this can be used to exhaust the server's capacity to\nprocess requests.\n\nThis vulnerability has been assigned the identifier CVE-2020-7663.\n\nWe believe this flaw stems from the grammar specified for this header.\n[RFC 6455][1] defines the grammar for the header as:\n\n    Sec-WebSocket-Extensions = extension-list\n\n    extension-list    = 1#extension\n    extension         = extension-token *( \";\" extension-param )\n    extension-token   = registered-token\n    registered-token  = token\n    extension-param   = token [ \"=\" (token | quoted-string) ]\n\nIt refers to [RFC 2616][2] for the definitions of `token` and\n`quoted-string`, which are:\n\n    token          = 1*<any CHAR except CTLs or separators>\n    separators     = \"(\" | \")\" | \"<\" | \">\" | \"@\"\n                   | \",\" | \";\" | \":\" | \"\\\" | <\">\n                   | \"/\" | \"[\" | \"]\" | \"?\" | \"=\"\n                   | \"{\" | \"}\" | SP | HT\n\n    quoted-string  = ( <\"> *(qdtext | quoted-pair ) <\"> )\n    qdtext         = <any TEXT except <\">>\n    quoted-pair    = \"\\\" CHAR\n\nThese rely on the `CHAR`, `CTL` and `TEXT` grammars, which are:\n\n    CHAR           = <any US-ASCII character (octets 0 - 127)>\n    CTL            = <any US-ASCII control character (octets 0 - 31) and DEL (127)>\n    TEXT           = <any OCTET except CTLs, but including LWS>\n\nOther relevant definitions to support these:\n\n    OCTET          = <any 8-bit sequence of data>\n    LWS            = [CRLF] 1*( SP | HT )\n    CRLF           = CR LF\n\n    HT             = <US-ASCII HT, horizontal-tab (9)>\n    LF             = <US-ASCII LF, linefeed (10)>\n    CR             = <US-ASCII CR, carriage return (13)>\n    SP             = <US-ASCII SP, space (32)>\n\nTo expand some of these terms out and write them as regular expressions:\n\n    OCTET         = [\\x00-\\xFF]\n    CHAR          = [\\x00-\\x7F]\n    TEXT          = [\\t \\x21-\\x7E\\x80-\\xFF]\n\nThe allowable bytes for `token` are [\\x00-\\x7F], except [\\x00-\\x1F\\x7F]\n(leaving [\\x20-\\x7E]) and `separators`, which leaves the following set\nof allowed chars:\n\n    ! # $ % & ' * + - . ^ _ ` | ~ [0-9] [A-Z] [a-z]\n\n`quoted-string` contains a repeated pattern of either `qdtext` or\n`quoted-pair`. `qdtext` is any `TEXT` byte except <\">, and the <\">\ncharacter is ASCII 34, or 0x22. The <!> character is 0x21. So `qdtext`\ncan be written either positively as:\n\n    qdtext        = [\\t !\\x23-\\x7E\\x80-\\xFF]\n\nor negatively, as:\n\n    qdtext        = [^\\x00-\\x08\\x0A-\\x1F\\x7F\"]\n\nWe use the negative definition here. The other alternative in the\n`quoted-string` pattern is:\n\n    quoted-pair   = \\\\[\\x00-\\x7F]\n\nThe problem is that the set of bytes matched by `qdtext` includes <\\>,\nand intersects with the second element of `quoted-pair`. That means the\nsequence \\c can be matched as either two `qdtext` bytes, or as a single\n`quoted-pair`. When the regex engine fails to find a trailing <\"> to\nclose the string, it back-tracks and tries every alternate parse for the\nstring, which doubles with each pair of bytes in the input.\n\nTo fix the ReDoS flaw we need to rewrite the repeating pattern so that\nnone of its alternate branches can match the same text. For example, we\ncould try dividing the set of bytes [\\x00-\\xFF] into those that must not\nfollow a <\\>, those that may follow a <\\>, and those that must be\npreceded by <\\>, and thereby construct a pattern of the form:\n\n    (A|\\?B|\\C)*\n\nwhere A, B and C have no characters in common. In our case the three\nbranch patterns would be:\n\n    A   =   qdtext - CHAR   =   [\\x80-\\xFF]\n    B   =   qdtext & CHAR   =   [\\t !\\x23-\\x7E]\n    C   =   CHAR - qdtext   =   [\\x00-\\x08\\x0A-\\x1F\\x7F\"]\n\nThese sets do not intersect, and notice <\"> appears in set C so must be\npreceded by <\\>. But we still have a problem: <\\> (0x5C) and all the\nalphabetic characters are in set B, so the pattern \\?B can match all\nthese:\n\n    c\n    \\\n    \\c\n\nSo the sequence \\c\\c\\c... still produces exponential back-tracking. It\nalso fails to parse input like this correctly:\n\n    Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: a; b=\"c\\\", d\"\n\nBecause the grammar allows a single backslash to appear by itself, this\nis arguably a syntax error where the parameter `b` has value `c\\` and\nthen a new extension `d` begins with a <\"> appearing where it should\nnot.\n\nSo the core problem is with the grammar itself: `qdtext` matches a\nsingle backslash <\\>, and `quoted-pair` matches a pair <\\\\>. So given a\nsequence of backslashes there's no canonical parse and the grammar is\nambiguous.\n\n[RFC 7230][3] remedies this problem and makes the grammar clearer.\nFirst, it defines `token` explicitly rather than implicitly:\n\n    token          = 1*tchar\n\n    tchar          = \"!\" / \"#\" / \"$\" / \"%\" / \"&\" / \"'\" / \"*\"\n                   / \"+\" / \"-\" / \".\" / \"^\" / \"_\" / \"`\" / \"|\" / \"~\"\n                   / DIGIT / ALPHA\n\nAnd second, it defines `quoted-string` so that backslashes cannot appear\non their own:\n\n     quoted-string  = DQUOTE *( qdtext / quoted-pair ) DQUOTE\n     qdtext         = HTAB / SP /%x21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E / obs-text\n     obs-text       = %x80-FF\n     quoted-pair    = \"\\\" ( HTAB / SP / VCHAR / obs-text )\n\nwhere VCHAR is any printing ASCII character 0x21-0x7E.

The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris).

Prior to versions 5.5.1 and 4.3.9, using `puma` with a proxy which forwards HTTP header values which contain the LF character could allow HTTP request smugggling. A client could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client. The only proxy which has this behavior, as far as the Puma team is aware of, is Apache Traffic Server. If the proxy uses persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests, and when processing the second request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another request for a different client, the second response from the first client will be sent to the second client. This vulnerability was patched in Puma 5.5.1 and 4.3.9. As a workaround, do not use Apache Traffic Server with `puma`.","project":"TRH-all_test","product":"TRH-all","cvss3Attributes":{"attackVector":"NETWORK","attackComplexity":"HIGH","userInteraction":"REQUIRED","privilegesRequired":"LOW","scope":"UNCHANGED","confidentialityImpact":"LOW","integrityImpact":"LOW","availabilityImpact":"NONE"},"library":{"keyUuid":"0ee846a0-4de5-429e-b21d-391e13104302","filename":"puma-3.12.0.gem","type":"RUBY_GEM","description":"Puma is a simple, fast, threaded, and highly concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications.

Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

In `@babel/traverse` prior to versions 7.23.2 and 8.0.0-alpha.4 and all versions of `babel-traverse`, using Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation, when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods. Known affected plugins are `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`; `@babel/preset-env` when using its `useBuiltIns` option; and any \"polyfill provider\" plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`, such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`. No other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace are impacted, but third-party plugins might be. Users that only compile trusted code are not impacted. The vulnerability has been fixed in `@babel/traverse@7.23.2` and `@babel/traverse@8.0.0-alpha.4`. Those who cannot upgrade `@babel/traverse` and are using one of the affected packages mentioned above should upgrade them to their latest version to avoid triggering the vulnerable code path in affected `@babel/traverse` versions: `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` v7.23.2, `@babel/preset-env` v7.23.2, `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` v0.4.3, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2` v0.4.6, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3` v0.8.5, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims` v0.10.0, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator` v0.5.3.","topFix":{"vulnerability":"CVE-2023-45133","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://github.com/babel/babel/security/advisories/GHSA-67hx-6x53-jw92","fixResolution":"@babel/traverse - 7.23.2","date":"2023-10-12","message":"Upgrade to version"},"allFixes":[],"fixResolutionText":"Upgrade to version @babel/traverse - 7.23.2","references":[]},"reachabilityInfo":{"reachable":false,"analyzed":false},"type":"SECURITY_VULNERABILITY","level":"MAJOR","library":{"keyUuid":"16b10729-968b-4419-8649-e39b9e117e9d","keyId":222446975,"filename":"traverse-7.18.11.tgz","type":"javascript/Node.js","resolvedType":"javascript/Node.js","languages":"javascript/Node.js","description":"The Babel Traverse module maintains the overall tree state, and is responsible for replacing, removing, and adding nodes","references":{"url":"https://registry.npmjs.org/@babel/traverse/-/traverse-7.18.11.tgz","homePage":"https://babel.dev/docs/en/next/babel-traverse","genericPackageIndex":"https://www.npmjs.org/package/@babel/traverse"},"sha1":"3d51f2afbd83ecf9912bcbb5c4d94e3d2ddaa16f","name":"@babel/traverse","artifactId":"traverse-7.18.11.tgz","version":"7.18.11","groupId":"@babel/traverse"},"project":"TRH-all_test","projectId":11463725,"projectToken":"831f4c2e5d484a20b279aaeaf0f220e315810aec2f5b4788a6632de886d0f493","directDependency":false,"description":"High:1","date":"2023-12-06","modifiedDate":"2023-12-06","status":"OPEN","time":1701868634000,"alertUuid":"e3a75c22-f223-4bc9-a5f2-1aaa606aaa3e"},{"vulnerability":{"name":"CVE-2019-11358","type":"CVE","severity":"medium","score":4.3,"cvss3_severity":"medium","cvss3_score":6.1,"scoreMetadataVector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:P","publishDate":"2019-04-20","lastUpdated":"2023-08-31","url":"https://www.mend.io/vulnerability-database/CVE-2019-11358","description":"jQuery before 3.4.0, as used in Drupal, Backdrop CMS, and other products, mishandles jQuery.extend(true, {}, ...) because of Object.prototype pollution.

This may be done via application configuration:```ruby# In config/application.rbconfig.action_view.sanitized_allowed_tags = [\"select\", \"style\"]```see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-action-viewOr it may be done with a `:tags` option to the Action View helper `sanitize`:```<%= sanitize @comment.body, tags: [\"select\", \"style\"] %>```see https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html#method-i-sanitizeOr it may be done with Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer directly:```ruby# class-level optionRails::Html::SafeListSanitizer.allowed_tags = [\"select\", \"style\"]```or```ruby# instance-level optionRails::Html::SafeListSanitizer.new.sanitize(@article.body, tags: [\"select\", \"style\"])```All users overriding the allowed tags by any of the above mechanisms to include both \"select\" and \"style\" should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.## ReleasesThe FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.## WorkaroundsRemove either `select` or `style` from the overridden allowed tags.## CreditsThis vulnerability was responsibly reported by [windshock](https://hackerone.com/windshock?type=user).","topFix":{"vulnerability":"CVE-2022-32209","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/cve-2022-32209-possible-xss-vulnerability-in-rails-sanitizer/80800","fixResolution":"rails-html-sanitizer - 1.4.3","date":"2022-06-24","message":"Upgrade to version"},"allFixes":[],"fixResolutionText":"Upgrade to version rails-html-sanitizer - 1.4.3","references":[]},"reachabilityInfo":{"reachable":false,"analyzed":false},"type":"SECURITY_VULNERABILITY","level":"MAJOR","library":{"keyUuid":"45c256a7-49e5-4b5a-9678-a609275db876","keyId":101849913,"filename":"rails-html-sanitizer-1.3.0.gem","type":"Ruby","resolvedType":"Ruby","languages":"Ruby","description":"HTML sanitization for Rails applications","references":{"url":"https://rubygems.org/gems/rails-html-sanitizer-1.3.0.gem","homePage":"https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer","genericPackageIndex":"https://rubygems.org/gems/rails-html-sanitizer/versions/1.3.0"},"sha1":"90c3c3d2c2cff685b1308b67ff441e94aae579d0","name":"rails-html-sanitizer","artifactId":"rails-html-sanitizer-1.3.0.gem","version":"1.3.0","groupId":"rails-html-sanitizer"},"project":"TRH-all_test","projectId":11463725,"projectToken":"831f4c2e5d484a20b279aaeaf0f220e315810aec2f5b4788a6632de886d0f493","directDependency":false,"description":"Medium:1","date":"2023-12-06","modifiedDate":"2023-12-06","status":"OPEN","time":1701868634000,"alertUuid":"53ed4f4d-6d1d-460f-b8ca-3ff1b828b353"},{"vulnerability":{"name":"CVE-2021-22902","type":"CVE","severity":"medium","score":5.0,"cvss3_severity":"high","cvss3_score":7.5,"scoreMetadataVector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","publishDate":"2021-06-11","lastUpdated":"2021-08-18","url":"https://www.mend.io/vulnerability-database/CVE-2021-22902","description":"The actionpack ruby gem (a framework for handling and responding to web requests in Rails) before 6.0.3.7, 6.1.3.2 suffers from a possible denial of service vulnerability in the Mime type parser of Action Dispatch.

Versions prior to 0.36.1, as well as those prior to 1.2.10 when used with the Ruby data source tzinfo-data, are vulnerable to relative path traversal. With the Ruby data source, time zones are defined in Ruby files. There is one file per time zone. Time zone files are loaded with `require` on demand. In the affected versions, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` fails to validate time zone identifiers correctly, allowing a new line character within the identifier. With Ruby version 1.9.3 and later, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` can be made to load unintended files with `require`, executing them within the Ruby process. Versions 0.3.61 and 1.2.10 include fixes to correctly validate time zone identifiers. Versions 2.0.0 and later are not vulnerable. Version 0.3.61 can still load arbitrary files from the Ruby load path if their name follows the rules for a valid time zone identifier and the file has a prefix of `tzinfo/definition` within a directory in the load path. Applications should ensure that untrusted files are not placed in a directory on the load path.

The only proxy which has this behavior, as far as the Puma team is aware of, is Apache Traffic Server. If the proxy uses persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests, and when processing the second request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another request for a different client, the second response from the first client will be sent to the second client.

This has been fixed in versions 4.3.2 and 3.12.3 by checking all headers for line endings and rejecting headers with those characters.","topFix":{"vulnerability":"CVE-2020-5247","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-84j7-475p-hp8v","fixResolution":"3.12.3;4.3.2","date":"2020-02-28","message":"Upgrade to version"},"allFixes":[{"vulnerability":"CVE-2020-5247","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-84j7-475p-hp8v","fixResolution":"3.12.3;4.3.2","date":"2020-02-28","message":"Upgrade to version"},{"vulnerability":"CVE-2020-5247","type":"CHANGE_FILES","origin":"GITHUB_COMMIT","url":"https://github.com/puma/puma/commit/694feafcd4fdcea786a0730701dad933f7547bea","fixResolution":"benchmarks/wrk/hello.sh,test/rackup/many_long_headers.ru,test/test_puma_server.rb,lib/puma/const.rb,test/rackup/realistic_response.ru,test/bundle_preservation_test/Gemfile.bundle_env_preservation_test.lock,lib/puma/server.rb,benchmarks/wrk/many_long_headers.sh,benchmarks/wrk/realistic_response.sh","date":"2020-02-27","message":"Merge pull request from GHSA-84j7-475p-hp8v\n\nheader value could inject a CR or LF and inject their own HTTP response."}],"fixResolutionText":"Upgrade to version 3.12.3;4.3.2","references":[]},"reachabilityInfo":{"reachable":false,"analyzed":false},"type":"SECURITY_VULNERABILITY","level":"MAJOR","library":{"keyUuid":"0ee846a0-4de5-429e-b21d-391e13104302","keyId":66033924,"filename":"puma-3.12.0.gem","type":"Ruby","resolvedType":"Ruby","languages":"Ruby","description":"Puma is a simple, fast, threaded, and highly concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications.

When an allowed host contains a leading dot, a specially crafted `Host` header can be used to redirect to a malicious website.","topFix":{"vulnerability":"CVE-2021-22881","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/cve-2021-22881-possible-open-redirect-in-host-authorization-middleware/77130","fixResolution":"6.0.3.5,6.1.2.1","date":"2021-02-11","message":"Upgrade to version"},"allFixes":[{"vulnerability":"CVE-2021-22881","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/cve-2021-22881-possible-open-redirect-in-host-authorization-middleware/77130","fixResolution":"6.0.3.5,6.1.2.1","date":"2021-02-11","message":"Upgrade to version"},{"vulnerability":"CVE-2021-22881","type":"CHANGE_FILES","origin":"GITHUB_COMMIT","url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/b5de7b3a4787d8a55aaad39f477c16e3af65e444","fixResolution":"actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/host_authorization.rb,actionpack/test/dispatch/host_authorization_test.rb","date":"2021-02-10","message":"Prevent open redirect when allowed host starts with a dot\n\n[CVE-2021-22881]\n\nThanks to @tktech (https://hackerone.com/tktech) for reporting this\nissue and the patch!"},{"vulnerability":"CVE-2021-22881","type":"CHANGE_FILES","origin":"GITHUB_COMMIT","url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/b5de7b3a4787d8a55aaad39f477c16e3af65e444","fixResolution":"actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/host_authorization.rb,actionpack/test/dispatch/host_authorization_test.rb","date":"2021-02-10","message":"Prevent open redirect when allowed host starts with a dot\n\n[CVE-2021-22881]\n\nThanks to @tktech (https://hackerone.com/tktech) for reporting this\nissue and the patch!"}],"fixResolutionText":"Upgrade to version 6.0.3.5,6.1.2.1","references":[]},"reachabilityInfo":{"reachable":false,"analyzed":false},"type":"SECURITY_VULNERABILITY","level":"MAJOR","library":{"keyUuid":"db01462a-3d38-4786-b8dd-8e9f112b4b61","keyId":140747672,"filename":"actionpack-6.0.0.gem","type":"Ruby","resolvedType":"Ruby","languages":"Ruby","description":"Web apps on Rails.

Prior to versions 5.5.1 and 4.3.9, using `puma` with a proxy which forwards HTTP header values which contain the LF character could allow HTTP request smugggling. A client could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client. The only proxy which has this behavior, as far as the Puma team is aware of, is Apache Traffic Server. If the proxy uses persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests, and when processing the second request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another request for a different client, the second response from the first client will be sent to the second client. This vulnerability was patched in Puma 5.5.1 and 4.3.9.

Due to the difference in the attribute parser of Dompdf and php-svg-lib, an attacker can still call arbitrary URLs with arbitrary protocols. Dompdf parses the href attribute of `image` tags and respects `xlink:href` even if `href` is specified. However, php-svg-lib, which is later used to parse the svg file, parses the href attribute. Since `href` is respected if both `xlink:href` and `href` is specified, it's possible to bypass the protection on the Dompdf side by providing an empty `xlink:href` attribute. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to call arbitrary URLs with arbitrary protocols if they provide an SVG file to the Dompdf. In PHP versions before 8.0.0, it leads to arbitrary unserialize, which will lead, at the very least, to arbitrary file deletion and might lead to remote code execution, depending on available classes. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `95009ea98` which has been included in release version 2.0.3. Users are advised to upgrade.

If no base directory is provided, it resolves to /, meaning that relative image URLs get treated as absolute local file paths and added as attachments. To form a remote vulnerability, the msgHTML method must be called, passed an unfiltered, user-supplied HTML document, and must not set a base directory.","topFix":{"vulnerability":"CVE-2017-5223","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5223","fixResolution":"5.2.22","date":"2017-01-16","message":"Upgrade to version"},"allFixes":[{"vulnerability":"CVE-2017-5223","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5223","fixResolution":"5.2.22","date":"2017-01-16","message":"Upgrade to version"},{"vulnerability":"CVE-2017-5223","type":"CHANGE_FILES","origin":"GITHUB_COMMIT","url":"https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/commit/ad4cb09682682da2217799a0c521d4cdc6753402","fixResolution":"class.phpmailer.php","date":"2017-01-06","message":"More careful checking of paths in msgHTML"}],"fixResolutionText":"Upgrade to version 5.2.22","references":[]},"reachabilityInfo":{"reachable":false,"analyzed":false},"type":"SECURITY_VULNERABILITY","level":"MAJOR","library":{"keyUuid":"eb486045-f2d2-4204-8740-037b16baa11c","keyId":103676266,"filename":"phpmailer/phpmailer-v5.2.20","type":"PHP","resolvedType":"PHP","languages":"PHP","description":"The classic email sending library for PHP","references":{"genericPackageIndex":"https://packagist.org/packages/phpmailer/phpmailer#v5.2.20"},"sha1":"5c9765c08c38ae3fd1772917bc6de9a7465062e6","name":"phpmailer/phpmailer","artifactId":"phpmailer/phpmailer","version":"v5.2.20","groupId":"phpmailer/phpmailer"},"project":"TRH-all_test","projectId":11463725,"projectToken":"831f4c2e5d484a20b279aaeaf0f220e315810aec2f5b4788a6632de886d0f493","directDependency":true,"description":"Medium:1","date":"2023-12-06","modifiedDate":"2023-12-06","status":"OPEN","time":1701868639000,"alertUuid":"b1ad59df-6183-4771-a586-6b59f23482ae"},{"vulnerability":{"name":"CVE-2022-27777","type":"CVE","severity":"medium","score":4.3,"cvss3_severity":"medium","cvss3_score":6.1,"scoreMetadataVector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","publishDate":"2022-05-26","lastUpdated":"2023-03-14","url":"https://www.mend.io/vulnerability-database/CVE-2022-27777","description":"A XSS Vulnerability in Action View tag helpers >= 5.2.0 and < 5.2.0 which would allow an attacker to inject content if able to control input into specific attributes.","topFix":{"vulnerability":"CVE-2022-27777","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ch3h-j2vf-95pv","fixResolution":"actionview - 5.2.7.1,6.0.4.8,6.1.5.1,7.0.2.4","date":"2022-05-26","message":"Upgrade to version"},"allFixes":[],"fixResolutionText":"Upgrade to version actionview - 5.2.7.1,6.0.4.8,6.1.5.1,7.0.2.4","references":[]},"reachabilityInfo":{"reachable":false,"analyzed":false},"type":"SECURITY_VULNERABILITY","level":"MAJOR","library":{"keyUuid":"cf9ee316-f7dc-42fe-8eef-730e6d985a4f","keyId":140747666,"filename":"actionview-6.0.0.gem","type":"Ruby","resolvedType":"Ruby","languages":"Ruby","description":"Simple, battle-tested conventions and helpers for building web pages.","references":{"url":"https://rubygems.org/gems/actionview-6.0.0.gem","homePage":"https://rubyonrails.org","genericPackageIndex":"https://rubygems.org/gems/actionview/versions/6.0.0"},"sha1":"d3cb5972c7f69affc8db32bca49bb05c200553dd","name":"actionview","artifactId":"actionview-6.0.0.gem","version":"6.0.0","groupId":"actionview"},"project":"TRH-all_test","projectId":11463725,"projectToken":"831f4c2e5d484a20b279aaeaf0f220e315810aec2f5b4788a6632de886d0f493","directDependency":false,"description":"Medium:1","date":"2023-12-06","modifiedDate":"2023-12-06","status":"OPEN","time":1701868634000,"alertUuid":"9e794ae6-4875-478f-9e19-e5073a43622e"},{"vulnerability":{"name":"CVE-2022-30122","type":"CVE","severity":"high","score":7.5,"cvss3_severity":"high","cvss3_score":7.5,"scoreMetadataVector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","publishDate":"2022-12-05","lastUpdated":"2023-10-30","url":"https://www.mend.io/vulnerability-database/CVE-2022-30122","description":"A possible denial of service vulnerability exists in Rack <2.0.9.1, <2.1.4.1 and <2.2.3.1 in the multipart parsing component of Rack.","topFix":{"vulnerability":"CVE-2022-30122","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hxqx-xwvh-44m2","fixResolution":"rack - 2.0.9.1,2.1.4.1,2.2.3.1","date":"2022-12-05","message":"Upgrade to version"},"allFixes":[],"fixResolutionText":"Upgrade to version rack - 2.0.9.1,2.1.4.1,2.2.3.1","references":[]},"reachabilityInfo":{"reachable":false,"analyzed":false},"type":"SECURITY_VULNERABILITY","level":"MAJOR","library":{"keyUuid":"d7db7d1e-d3e2-4cec-afdb-61c39f10fb70","keyId":70205925,"filename":"rack-2.0.6.gem","type":"Ruby","resolvedType":"Ruby","languages":"Ruby","description":"Rack provides a minimal, modular and adaptable interface for developing\nweb applications in Ruby.

The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris).

Since undici handles headers more liberally than the spec, there was a disconnect from the assumptions the spec made, and undici's implementation of fetch. As such this may lead to accidental leakage of cookie to a third-party site or a malicious attacker who can control the redirection target (ie. an open redirector) to leak the cookie to the third party site.

The <!> character is 0x21. So `qdtext`\ncan be written either positively as:\n\n    qdtext        = [\\t !\\x23-\\x7E\\x80-\\xFF]\n\nor negatively, as:\n\n    qdtext        = [^\\x00-\\x08\\x0A-\\x1F\\x7F\"]\n\nWe use the negative definition here. The other alternative in the\n`quoted-string` pattern is:\n\n    quoted-pair   = \\\\[\\x00-\\x7F]\n\nThe problem is that the set of bytes matched by `qdtext` includes <\\>,\nand intersects with the second element of `quoted-pair`. That means the\nsequence \\c can be matched as either two `qdtext` bytes, or as a single\n`quoted-pair`. When the regex engine fails to find a trailing <\"> to\nclose the string, it back-tracks and tries every alternate parse for the\nstring, which doubles with each pair of bytes in the input.\n\nTo fix the ReDoS flaw we need to rewrite the repeating pattern so that\nnone of its alternate branches can match the same text. For example, we\ncould try dividing the set of bytes [\\x00-\\xFF] into those that must not\nfollow a <\\>, those that may follow a <\\>, and those that must be\npreceded by <\\>, and thereby construct a pattern of the form:\n\n    (A|\\?B|\\C)*\n\nwhere A, B and C have no characters in common. In our case the three\nbranch patterns would be:\n\n    A   =   qdtext - CHAR   =   [\\x80-\\xFF]\n    B   =   qdtext & CHAR   =   [\\t !\\x23-\\x7E]\n    C   =   CHAR - qdtext   =   [\\x00-\\x08\\x0A-\\x1F\\x7F\"]\n\nThese sets do not intersect, and notice <\"> appears in set C so must be\npreceded by <\\>. But we still have a problem: <\\> (0x5C) and all the\nalphabetic characters are in set B, so the pattern \\?B can match all\nthese:\n\n    c\n    \\\n    \\c\n\nSo the sequence \\c\\c\\c... still produces exponential back-tracking. It\nalso fails to parse input like this correctly:\n\n    Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: a; b=\"c\\\", d\"\n\nBecause the grammar allows a single backslash to appear by itself, this\nis arguably a syntax error where the parameter `b` has value `c\\` and\nthen a new extension `d` begins with a <\"> appearing where it should\nnot.\n\nSo the core problem is with the grammar itself: `qdtext` matches a\nsingle backslash <\\>, and `quoted-pair` matches a pair <\\\\>. So given a\nsequence of backslashes there's no canonical parse and the grammar is\nambiguous.\n\n[RFC 7230][3] remedies this problem and makes the grammar clearer.\nFirst, it defines `token` explicitly rather than implicitly:\n\n    token          = 1*tchar\n\n    tchar          = \"!\" / \"#\" / \"$\" / \"%\" / \"&\" / \"'\" / \"*\"\n                   / \"+\" / \"-\" / \".\" / \"^\" / \"_\" / \"`\" / \"|\" / \"~\"\n                   / DIGIT / ALPHA\n\nAnd second, it defines `quoted-string` so that backslashes cannot appear\non their own:\n\n     quoted-string  = DQUOTE *( qdtext / quoted-pair ) DQUOTE\n     qdtext         = HTAB / SP /%x21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E / obs-text\n     obs-text       = %x80-FF\n     quoted-pair    = \"\\\" ( HTAB / SP / VCHAR / obs-text )\n\nwhere VCHAR is any printing ASCII character 0x21-0x7E. Notice `qdtext`\nis just our previous definition but with 5C excluded, so it cannot\naccept a single backslash.\n\nThis commit makes this modification to our matching patterns, and\nthereby removes the ReDoS vector.

The parser takes exponential time to reject this header as\ninvalid, and this can be used to exhaust the server's capacity to\nprocess requests.\n\nThis vulnerability has been assigned the identifier CVE-2020-7663.\n\nWe believe this flaw stems from the grammar specified for this header.\n[RFC 6455][1] defines the grammar for the header as:\n\n    Sec-WebSocket-Extensions = extension-list\n\n    extension-list    = 1#extension\n    extension         = extension-token *( \";\" extension-param )\n    extension-token   = registered-token\n    registered-token  = token\n    extension-param   = token [ \"=\" (token | quoted-string) ]\n\nIt refers to [RFC 2616][2] for the definitions of `token` and\n`quoted-string`, which are:\n\n    token          = 1*<any CHAR except CTLs or separators>\n    separators     = \"(\" | \")\" | \"<\" | \">\" | \"@\"\n                   | \",\" | \";\" | \":\" | \"\\\" | <\">\n                   | \"/\" | \"[\" | \"]\" | \"?\" | \"=\"\n                   | \"{\" | \"}\" | SP | HT\n\n    quoted-string  = ( <\"> *(qdtext | quoted-pair ) <\"> )\n    qdtext         = <any TEXT except <\">>\n    quoted-pair    = \"\\\" CHAR\n\nThese rely on the `CHAR`, `CTL` and `TEXT` grammars, which are:\n\n    CHAR           = <any US-ASCII character (octets 0 - 127)>\n    CTL            = <any US-ASCII control character (octets 0 - 31) and DEL (127)>\n    TEXT           = <any OCTET except CTLs, but including LWS>\n\nOther relevant definitions to support these:\n\n    OCTET          = <any 8-bit sequence of data>\n    LWS            = [CRLF] 1*( SP | HT )\n    CRLF           = CR LF\n\n    HT             = <US-ASCII HT, horizontal-tab (9)>\n    LF             = <US-ASCII LF, linefeed (10)>\n    CR             = <US-ASCII CR, carriage return (13)>\n    SP             = <US-ASCII SP, space (32)>\n\nTo expand some of these terms out and write them as regular expressions:\n\n    OCTET         = [\\x00-\\xFF]\n    CHAR          = [\\x00-\\x7F]\n    TEXT          = [\\t \\x21-\\x7E\\x80-\\xFF]\n\nThe allowable bytes for `token` are [\\x00-\\x7F], except [\\x00-\\x1F\\x7F]\n(leaving [\\x20-\\x7E]) and `separators`, which leaves the following set\nof allowed chars:\n\n    ! # $ % & ' * + - . ^ _ ` | ~ [0-9] [A-Z] [a-z]\n\n`quoted-string` contains a repeated pattern of either `qdtext` or\n`quoted-pair`. `qdtext` is any `TEXT` byte except <\">, and the <\">\ncharacter is ASCII 34, or 0x22. The <!> character is 0x21. So `qdtext`\ncan be written either positively as:\n\n    qdtext        = [\\t !\\x23-\\x7E\\x80-\\xFF]\n\nor negatively, as:\n\n    qdtext        = [^\\x00-\\x08\\x0A-\\x1F\\x7F\"]\n\nWe use the negative definition here. The other alternative in the\n`quoted-string` pattern is:\n\n    quoted-pair   = \\\\[\\x00-\\x7F]\n\nThe problem is that the set of bytes matched by `qdtext` includes <\\>,\nand intersects with the second element of `quoted-pair`. That means the\nsequence \\c can be matched as either two `qdtext` bytes, or as a single\n`quoted-pair`. When the regex engine fails to find a trailing <\"> to\nclose the string, it back-tracks and tries every alternate parse for the\nstring, which doubles with each pair of bytes in the input.\n\nTo fix the ReDoS flaw we need to rewrite the repeating pattern so that\nnone of its alternate branches can match the same text. For example, we\ncould try dividing the set of bytes [\\x00-\\xFF] into those that must not\nfollow a <\\>, those that may follow a <\\>, and those that must be\npreceded by <\\>, and thereby construct a pattern of the form:\n\n    (A|\\?B|\\C)*\n\nwhere A, B and C have no characters in common. In our case the three\nbranch patterns would be:\n\n    A   =   qdtext - CHAR   =   [\\x80-\\xFF]\n    B   =   qdtext & CHAR   =   [\\t !\\x23-\\x7E]\n    C   =   CHAR - qdtext   =   [\\x00-\\x08\\x0A-\\x1F\\x7F\"]\n\nThese sets do not intersect, and notice <\"> appears in set C so must be\npreceded by <\\>. But we still have a problem: <\\> (0x5C) and all the\nalphabetic characters are in set B, so the pattern \\?B can match all\nthese:\n\n    c\n    \\\n    \\c\n\nSo the sequence \\c\\c\\c... still produces exponential back-tracking. It\nalso fails to parse input like this correctly:\n\n    Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: a; b=\"c\\\", d\"\n\nBecause the grammar allows a single backslash to appear by itself, this\nis arguably a syntax error where the parameter `b` has value `c\\` and\nthen a new extension `d` begins with a <\"> appearing where it should\nnot.\n\nSo the core problem is with the grammar itself: `qdtext` matches a\nsingle backslash <\\>, and `quoted-pair` matches a pair <\\\\>. So given a\nsequence of backslashes there's no canonical parse and the grammar is\nambiguous.\n\n[RFC 7230][3] remedies this problem and makes the grammar clearer.\nFirst, it defines `token` explicitly rather than implicitly:\n\n    token          = 1*tchar\n\n    tchar          = \"!\" / \"#\" / \"$\" / \"%\" / \"&\" / \"'\" / \"*\"\n                   / \"+\" / \"-\" / \".\" / \"^\" / \"_\" / \"`\" / \"|\" / \"~\"\n                   / DIGIT / ALPHA\n\nAnd second, it defines `quoted-string` so that backslashes cannot appear\non their own:\n\n     quoted-string  = DQUOTE *( qdtext / quoted-pair ) DQUOTE\n     qdtext         = HTAB / SP /%x21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E / obs-text\n     obs-text       = %x80-FF\n     quoted-pair    = \"\\\" ( HTAB / SP / VCHAR / obs-text )\n\nwhere VCHAR is any printing ASCII character 0x21-0x7E. Notice `qdtext`\nis just our previous definition but with 5C excluded, so it cannot\naccept a single backslash.\n\nThis commit makes this modification to our matching patterns, and\nthereby removes the ReDoS vector. Technically this means it does not\nmatch the grammar of RFC 6455, but we expect this to have little or no\npractical impact, especially since the one main protocol extension,\n`permessage-deflate` ([RFC 7692][4]), does not have any string-valued\nparameters.\n\n[1]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-9.1\n[2]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-2.2\n[3]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.6\n[4]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7692"}],"fixResolutionText":"Upgrade to version websocket-extensions:0.1.5","references":[]},"reachabilityInfo":{"reachable":false,"analyzed":false},"type":"SECURITY_VULNERABILITY","level":"MAJOR","library":{"keyUuid":"e9340e3f-d766-4d4c-b1b5-fcf436435329","keyId":35456832,"filename":"websocket-extensions-0.1.3.gem","type":"Ruby","resolvedType":"Ruby","languages":"Ruby","references":{"url":"https://rubygems.org/gems/websocket-extensions-0.1.3.gem","homePage":"https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-ruby","genericPackageIndex":"https://rubygems.org/gems/websocket-extensions/versions/0.1.3"},"sha1":"e3ec3cdccf56d8649c47e92820e05d7e7b635c23","name":"websocket-extensions","artifactId":"websocket-extensions-0.1.3.gem","version":"0.1.3","groupId":"websocket-extensions"},"project":"TRH-all_test","projectId":11463725,"projectToken":"831f4c2e5d484a20b279aaeaf0f220e315810aec2f5b4788a6632de886d0f493","directDependency":false,"description":"High:1","date":"2023-12-06","modifiedDate":"2023-12-06","status":"OPEN","time":1701868634000,"alertUuid":"9dbd9fc2-350b-451d-b950-0503419f687c"},{"vulnerability":{"name":"CVE-2022-23541","type":"CVE","severity":"medium","score":6.3,"cvss3_severity":"medium","cvss3_score":6.3,"scoreMetadataVector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","publishDate":"2022-12-22","lastUpdated":"2023-02-27","url":"https://www.mend.io/vulnerability-database/CVE-2022-23541","description":"jsonwebtoken is an implementation of JSON Web Tokens.

A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.","topFix":{"vulnerability":"CVE-2021-29509","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-q28m-8xjw-8vr5","fixResolution":"puma - 4.3.8,5.3.1","date":"2021-05-11","message":"Upgrade to version"},"allFixes":[],"fixResolutionText":"Upgrade to version puma - 4.3.8,5.3.1","references":[]},"reachabilityInfo":{"reachable":false,"analyzed":false},"type":"SECURITY_VULNERABILITY","level":"MAJOR","library":{"keyUuid":"0ee846a0-4de5-429e-b21d-391e13104302","keyId":66033924,"filename":"puma-3.12.0.gem","type":"Ruby","resolvedType":"Ruby","languages":"Ruby","description":"Puma is a simple, fast, threaded, and highly concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications.

The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including versions 1.0.1 and 2.2.1 does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse` should restrict parsing of `__proto__` keys when parsing JSON strings to objects. As a point of reference, the `JSON.parse` method included in JavaScript ignores `__proto__` keys. Simply changing `JSON5.parse` to `JSON.parse` in the examples above mitigates this vulnerability. This vulnerability is patched in json5 versions 1.0.2, 2.2.2, and later.","topFix":{"vulnerability":"CVE-2022-46175","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-46175","fixResolution":"json5 - 2.2.2","date":"2022-12-24","message":"Upgrade to version"},"allFixes":[],"fixResolutionText":"Upgrade to version json5 - 2.2.2","references":[]},"reachabilityInfo":{"reachable":false,"analyzed":false},"type":"SECURITY_VULNERABILITY","level":"MAJOR","library":{"keyUuid":"40aaba56-77cc-43b4-96ac-c0365374688a","keyId":197918092,"filename":"json5-2.2.1.tgz","type":"javascript/Node.js","resolvedType":"javascript/Node.js","languages":"javascript/Node.js","description":"JSON for humans.","references":{"url":"https://registry.npmjs.org/json5/-/json5-2.2.1.tgz","homePage":"http://json5.org/","genericPackageIndex":"https://www.npmjs.org/package/json5"},"sha1":"655d50ed1e6f95ad1a3caababd2b0efda10b395c","name":"json5","artifactId":"json5-2.2.1.tgz","version":"2.2.1","groupId":"json5"},"project":"TRH-all_test","projectId":11463725,"projectToken":"831f4c2e5d484a20b279aaeaf0f220e315810aec2f5b4788a6632de886d0f493","directDependency":false,"description":"High:1","date":"2023-12-06","modifiedDate":"2023-12-06","status":"OPEN","time":1701868634000,"alertUuid":"4a424518-6061-4472-9f01-70143b78e0f5"},{"vulnerability":{"name":"WS-2022-0089","type":"WS","severity":"high","score":8.8,"cvss3_severity":"high","cvss3_score":8.8,"scoreMetadataVector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","publishDate":"2022-03-01","lastUpdated":"2022-03-01","url":"https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/commit/472913378794b8cae21751b0777205e7c0606a95","description":"Nokogiri before version 1.13.2 is vulnerable.","topFix":{"vulnerability":"WS-2022-0089","type":"UPGRADE_VERSION","origin":"WHITESOURCE_EXPERT","url":"https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-fq42-c5rg-92c2","fixResolution":"nokogiri - v1.13.2","date":"2022-03-01","message":"Upgrade to version"},"allFixes":[],"fixResolutionText":"Upgrade to version nokogiri - v1.13.2","references":[]},"reachabilityInfo":{"reachable":false,"analyzed":false},"type":"SECURITY_VULNERABILITY","level":"MAJOR","library":{"keyUuid":"fce4c67e-8058-4512-bcc3-8828dff8e0ed","keyId":116928166,"filename":"nokogiri-1.10.10.gem","type":"Ruby","resolvedType":"Ruby","languages":"Ruby","description":"Nokogiri (鋸) is an HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parser.

Seguin\n\nminitest/test is a small and incredibly fast unit testing framework.\nIt provides a rich set of assertions to make your tests clean and\nreadable.\n\nminitest/spec is a functionally complete spec engine. It hooks onto\nminitest/test and seamlessly bridges test assertions over to spec\nexpectations.\n\nminitest/benchmark is an awesome way to assert the performance of your\nalgorithms in a repeatable manner. Now you can assert that your newb\nco-worker doesn't replace your linear algorithm with an exponential\none!\n\nminitest/mock by Steven Baker, is a beautifully tiny mock (and stub)\nobject framework.\n\nminitest/pride shows pride in testing and adds coloring to your test\noutput. I guess it is an example of how to write IO pipes too. :P\n\nminitest/test is meant to have a clean implementation for language\nimplementors that need a minimal set of methods to bootstrap a working\ntest suite.

implements a fast, single-threaded engine for arbitrary network\ncommunications. It's extremely easy to use in Ruby. EventMachine wraps all\ninteractions with IP sockets, allowing programs to concentrate on the\nimplementation of network protocols. It can be used to create both network\nservers and clients. To create a server or client, a Ruby program only needs\nto specify the IP address and port, and provide a Module that implements the\ncommunications protocol. Implementations of several standard network protocols\nare provided with the package, primarily to serve as examples. The real goal\nof EventMachine is to enable programs to easily interface with other programs\nusing TCP/IP, especially if custom protocols are required.\n","references":{"url":"https://rubygems.org/gems/eventmachine-1.2.7.gem","homePage":"http://rubyeventmachine.com","genericPackageIndex":"https://rubygems.org/gems/eventmachine/versions/1.2.7"},"directDependency":false,"projects":[{"projectName":"TRH-all_test","projectToken":"831f4c2e5d484a20b279aaeaf0f220e315810aec2f5b4788a6632de886d0f493"}],"sha1":"7a5b2896e210fac9759c786ee4510f265f75b481","name":"eventmachine","artifactId":"eventmachine-1.2.7.gem","version":"1.2.7","groupId":"eventmachine","licenses":[{"name":"GPL

Kirk Haines and I were\n     paired up and we cracked open the code for a few test\n     frameworks...\n\n     I MUST say that minitest is *very* readable / understandable\n     compared to the 'other two' options we looked at.

Seguin\n\nminitest/test is a small and incredibly fast unit testing framework.\nIt provides a rich set of assertions to make your tests clean and\nreadable.\n\nminitest/spec is a functionally complete spec engine. It hooks onto\nminitest/test and seamlessly bridges test assertions over to spec\nexpectations.\n\nminitest/benchmark is an awesome way to assert the performance of your\nalgorithms in a repeatable manner. Now you can assert that your newb\nco-worker doesn't replace your linear algorithm with an exponential\none!\n\nminitest/mock by Steven Baker, is a beautifully tiny mock (and stub)\nobject framework.\n\nminitest/pride shows pride in testing and adds coloring to your test\noutput. I guess it is an example of how to write IO pipes too. :P\n\nminitest/test is meant to have a clean implementation for language\nimplementors that need a minimal set of methods to bootstrap a working\ntest suite. For example, there is no magic involved for test-case\ndiscovery.\n\n    \"Again, I can't praise enough the idea of a testing/specing\n     framework that I can actually read in full in one sitting!\"\n\n    -- Piotr Szotkowski\n\nComparing to rspec:\n\n    rspec is a testing DSL. minitest is ruby.\n\n    -- Adam Hawkins, \"Bow Before MiniTest\"\n\nminitest doesn't reinvent anything that ruby already provides, like:\nclasses, modules, inheritance, methods.
