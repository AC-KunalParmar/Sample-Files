                <para text="Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed occur whenever a web application uses untrusted data in the output it generates without validating or encoding it.  XSS vulnerabilities are commonly exploited to steal or manipulate cookies, modify presentation of content, and compromise sensitive information, with new attack vectors being discovered on a regular basis.  XSS is also commonly referred to as HTML injection." />
                <para text="XSS vulnerabilities can be either persistent or transient (often referred to as stored and reflected, respectively).  In a persistent XSS vulnerability, the injected code is stored by the application, for example within a blog comment or message board.  The attack occurs whenever a victim views the page containing the malicious script.  In a transient XSS vulnerability, the injected code is included directly in the HTTP request.  These attacks are often carried out via malicious URLs sent via email or another website and requires the victim to browse to that link.  The consequence of an XSS attack to a victim is the same regardless of whether it is persistent or transient; however, persistent XSS vulnerabilities are likely to affect a greater number of victims due to its delivery mechanism." />

Avoid proprietary encryption algorithms as they typically rely on &quot;security through obscurity&quot; rather than sound mathematics.  Select key sizes appropriate for the data being protected; for high assurance applications, 256-bit symmetric keys and 2048-bit asymmetric keys are sufficient.  Follow best practices for key storage, and ensure that plaintext data and key material are not inadvertently exposed." />
