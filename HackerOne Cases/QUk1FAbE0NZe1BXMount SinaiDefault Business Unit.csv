109292529,"**Title :PII disclosure via unauthenticated access in https://apps.mountsinai.org**

## Report: 
## Summary:
I have noticed that after someones registers for a course from https://apps.mountsinai.org/app/mchregister/mshCourseSchedule/listedCourses they are redirected to a page at https://apps.mountsinai.org/app/mchregister/courseRegistration/enrollmentPayment/[ID] where the given PII is reflected back in the response. Because this endpoint does not impose any sort of ownership validation, everyone can access that data :
- names
- email
- address
- phone
- other details

You can also cancel the registration, hence the integrity impact.

A lot of PII is disclosed, hence I think that this issue is a critical one

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Go to https://apps.mountsinai.org/app/mchregister/mshCourseSchedule/listedCourses and register for a course
2. You should be redirected to a page like https://apps.mountsinai.org/app/mchregister/courseRegistration/enrollmentPayment/[ID] 
3. In another browser access the same link from step 2 and you should see the patient's PII

Feel free to use my registration at https://apps.mountsinai.org/app/mchregister/courseRegistration/enrollmentPayment/362169

## Supporting Material/References:
Screenshot attached

## Impact

PII disclosure + registration cancelling for courses :
- names
- email
- address
- phone
- other details

**Weakness** : [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/639.html)
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.
