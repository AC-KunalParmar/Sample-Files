  - Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant     code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead     of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor     present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used     then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery     during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability     to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present     are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because     explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL     1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s). (CVE-2019-1547)

  - There is an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit     moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime     RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed     likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have     to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low     level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1e (Affected     1.1.1-1.1.1d). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2u (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2t). (CVE-2019-1551)

  - In situations where an attacker receives automated notification of the success or failure of a decryption     attempt an attacker, after sending a very large number of messages to be decrypted, can recover a     CMS/PKCS7 transported encryption key or decrypt any RSA encrypted message that was encrypted with the     public RSA key, using a Bleichenbacher padding oracle attack. Applications are not affected if they use a     certificate together with the private RSA key to the CMS_decrypt or PKCS7_decrypt functions to select the     correct recipient info to decrypt. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL     1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s). (CVE-2019-1563)

  - The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to     compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In     such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent     over that TLS connection. The attack can only be exploited if an implementation re-uses a DH secret across     multiple TLS connections. Note that this issue only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites.
    This issue affects OpenSSL 1.0.2 which is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. OpenSSL     1.1.1 is not vulnerable to this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2w (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2v). (CVE-2020-1968)

  - The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name     types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different     instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both     GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a     possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1)     Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in     an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp     authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an     attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if     the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL     then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a     certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified.
    OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the -crl_download option which implements     automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an     unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of     EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will     accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue.
    Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected     1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w). (CVE-2020-1971)

  - BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are configured to use GSS-TSIG     features. In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed,     but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or     tkey-gssapi-credentialconfiguration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-     TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server     environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. The most likely outcome     of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability is a crash of the named process. However, remote code     execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects: BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.11,     and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.27-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.11-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition.
    Also release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development branch (CVE-2020-8625)

  - Calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate may overflow the output length argument     in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable length for an integer on the     platform.

  - The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based     on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly     handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is     maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a     potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by     OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on     certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are     affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x     and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving     public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should     upgrade to 1.1.1j.

  - In BIND 9.0.0 -> 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.29-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 ->     9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.11 of the BIND     9.17 development branch, when a vulnerable version of named receives a query for a record triggering the     flaw described above, the named process will terminate due to a failed assertion check. The vulnerability     affects all currently maintained BIND 9 branches (9.11, 9.11-S, 9.16, 9.16-S, 9.17) as well as all other     versions of BIND 9. (CVE-2021-25215)

  - In BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.29-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 ->     9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the BIND     9.17 development branch, BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are     configured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable     code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting values for the     tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential configuration options. Although the default configuration is     not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in     mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. For servers     that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on     the CPU architecture for which BIND was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this flaw     can be used to trigger a buffer over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for     32-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overflow and possibly     also to achieve remote code execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are     available in the MIT and Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems,     rendering the ISC implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for     BIND users, we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16     (it had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable ESV     (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO implementation,     we have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.

  - In ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -> 4.1-ESV-R16, ISC DHCP 4.4.0 -> 4.4.2 (Other branches of ISC DHCP (i.e., releases     in the 4.0.x series or lower and releases in the 4.3.x series) are beyond their End-of-Life (EOL) and no     longer supported by ISC. From inspection it is clear that the defect is also present in releases from     those series, but they have not been officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering     the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected     (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler     flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced     the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when     reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to     the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd     server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to     the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in     lack of service to clients. Additionally, the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in     the lease database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 64-bit     architecture OR if the -fstack-protection-strong compiler flag was NOT specified, the crash will not     occur, but it is possible for the offending lease and the lease which immediately followed it to be     improperly deleted.

  - In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function     EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the     out parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the outlen parameter is populated with the buffer size     required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer     and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the out parameter. A bug     in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to     hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size     required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the     application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2     content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to     a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing     application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application     dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).
    (CVE-2021-3711)

  - ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a     buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings     which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not     a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own d2i functions (and other similar     parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will     additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for     applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array     by directly setting the data and length fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using     the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to     assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for     strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be     printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the     application without NUL terminating the data field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing     can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been     directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the     certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the     X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an     application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL     functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack).
    It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive     plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected     1.0.2-1.0.2y). (CVE-2021-3712)

  - In shadow before 4.5, the newusers tool could be made to manipulate internal data structures in ways     unintended by the authors. Malformed input may lead to crashes (with a buffer overflow or other memory     corruption) or other unspecified behaviors. This crosses a privilege boundary in, for example, certain     web-hosting environments in which a Control Panel allows an unprivileged user account to create     subaccounts. (CVE-2017-12424)

  - An issue was discovered in shadow 4.5. newgidmap (in shadow-utils) is setuid and allows an unprivileged     user to be placed in a user namespace where setgroups(2) is permitted. This allows an attacker to remove     themselves from a supplementary group, which may allow access to certain filesystem paths if the     administrator has used group blacklisting (e.g., chmod g-rwx) to restrict access to paths. This flaw     effectively reverts a security feature in the kernel (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups knob) to     prevent this sort of privilege escalation. (CVE-2018-7169)

  - The iconv program in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.31 and earlier, when invoked with multiple     suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with the -c option, enters an infinite     loop when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2016-10228)

  - The iconv feature in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.32, when processing invalid multi-     byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer over-read. (CVE-2019-25013)

  - An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc     2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative     value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the     'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-     of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows     for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred.
    The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this     corrupted data. (CVE-2020-6096)

  - The iconv function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.32 and earlier, when processing invalid     multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390, and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance     the input state, which could lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of service, a     different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228. (CVE-2020-27618)

  - The iconv function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.30 to 2.32, when converting UCS4 text     containing an irreversible character, fails an assertion in the code path and aborts the program,     potentially resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2020-29562)

  - The iconv function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.32 and earlier, when processing invalid     input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in the code path and aborts the program,     potentially resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3326)

  - The nameserver caching daemon (nscd) in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.29 through 2.33, when     processing a request for netgroup lookup, may crash due to a double-free, potentially resulting in     degraded service or Denial of Service on the local system. This is related to netgroupcache.c.
    (CVE-2021-27645)

  - The wordexp function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2.33 may crash or read arbitrary memory in     parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in     a denial of service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was used but strtoul should     have been used to ensure correct calculations. (CVE-2021-35942)

  - The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc module of the GNU C Library (aka glibc)     through 2.34 copies its path argument on the stack without validating its length, which may result in a     buffer overflow, potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is not built with a     stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2022-23218)

  - The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module of the GNU C Library (aka glibc)     through 2.34 copies its hostname argument on the stack without validating its length, which may result in     a buffer overflow, potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is not built with a     stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

  - The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop     forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain     elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point     encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has     invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the     certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a     denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they     can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients     consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking     certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from     subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that     use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS     issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate     which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the     public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-     signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue     affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the     15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected     1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc). (CVE-2022-0778)

  - A flaw was found in Python, specifically within the urllib.parse module. This module helps break Uniform     Resource Locator (URL) strings into components. The issue involves how the urlparse method does not     sanitize input and allows characters like '\r' and ' ' in the URL path. This flaw allows an attacker to     input a crafted URL, leading to injection attacks. This flaw affects Python versions prior to 3.10.0b1,     3.9.5, 3.8.11, 3.7.11 and 3.6.14. (CVE-2022-0391)

  - There's a flaw in Python 3's pydoc. A local or adjacent attacker who discovers or is able to convince     another local or adjacent user to start a pydoc server could access the server and use it to disclose     sensitive information belonging to the other user that they would not normally be able to access. The     highest risk of this flaw is to data confidentiality. This flaw affects Python versions before 3.8.9,     Python versions before 3.9.3 and Python versions before 3.10.0a7. (CVE-2021-3426)

  - A flaw was found in Python, specifically in the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client library in PASV     (passive) mode. The issue is how the FTP client trusts the host from the PASV response by default. This     flaw allows an attacker to set up a malicious FTP server that can trick FTP clients into connecting back     to a given IP address and port. This vulnerability could lead to FTP client scanning ports, which     otherwise would not have been possible. (CVE-2021-4189)

  - An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through 5.0 patch 11. By default, if     Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its     effective UID to its real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support     saved UID functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell     can use enable -f for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid()     and therefore regains privileges. However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.

  - The c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection. This     script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such     operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of     the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.
    Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1o (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1n).

  - The function `OCSP_basic_verify` verifies the signer certificate on an OCSP response. In the case where     the (non-default) flag OCSP_NOCHECKS is used then the response will be positive (meaning a successful     verification) even in the case where the response signing certificate fails to verify. It is anticipated     that most users of `OCSP_basic_verify` will not use the OCSP_NOCHECKS flag. In this case the     `OCSP_basic_verify` function will return a negative value (indicating a fatal error) in the case of a     certificate verification failure. The normal expected return value in this case would be 0. This issue     also impacts the command line OpenSSL ocsp application. When verifying an ocsp response with the
    -no_cert_checks option the command line application will report that the verification is successful even     though it has in fact failed. In this case the incorrect successful response will also be accompanied by     error messages showing the failure and contradicting the apparently successful result. Fixed in OpenSSL     3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). (CVE-2022-1343)

  - The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite incorrectly uses the AAD data as the MAC key.
    This makes the MAC key trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-     the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the     modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint     to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at     that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first.
    Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0     client. If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both     directions. In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application     protocol. Note that in the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint     communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the handshake when using this     ciphersuite. The confidentiality of data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt     data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it. In order for this attack to     work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled     by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default provider or the default ciphersuite     list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0     endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred: 1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with     the (non-default) compile time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider     explicitly loaded (either through application code or via configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been     explicitly added to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default is     1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must negotiate the     RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in common Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3     (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). (CVE-2022-1434)

  - The OPENSSL_LH_flush() function, which empties a hash table, contains a bug that breaks reuse of the     memory occuppied by the removed hash table entries. This function is used when decoding certificates or     keys. If a long lived process periodically decodes certificates or keys its memory usage will expand     without bounds and the process might be terminated by the operating system causing a denial of service.
    Also traversing the empty hash table entries will take increasingly more time. Typically such long lived     processes might be TLS clients or TLS servers configured to accept client certificate authentication. The     function was added in the OpenSSL 3.0 version thus older releases are not affected by the issue. Fixed in     OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). (CVE-2022-1473)

  - Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap     buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other     malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But     there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read.
    While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the     octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence     of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote     exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing     modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`,     `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to     directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module     `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present     on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be     specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important     modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability. (CVE-2022-24903)

  - In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances     where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection     were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other     places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command     executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is     automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the     privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the     OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3).

  - In ISC DHCP 1.0 -> 4.4.3, ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -> 4.1-ESV-R16-P1 a system with access to a DHCP server,     sending DHCP packets crafted to include fqdn labels longer than 63 bytes, could eventually cause the     server to run out of memory. (CVE-2022-2929)

  - In ISC DHCP 4.4.0 -> 4.4.3, ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -> 4.1-ESV-R16-P1, when the function     option_code_hash_lookup() is called from add_option(), it increases the option's refcount field. However,     there is not a corresponding call to option_dereference() to decrement the refcount field. The function     add_option() is only used in server responses to lease query packets. Each lease query response calls this     function for several options, so eventually, the reference counters could overflow and cause the server to     abort. (CVE-2022-2928)

  - NULL Pointer Dereference allows attackers to cause a denial of service (or application crash). This only     applies when lxml is used together with libxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2 2.9.9 and earlier are not     affected. It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable code sequence in the     application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize     function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be     replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an XML converter that serialises to C14N     would also be vulnerable, for example, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence. If     untrusted input is received (also remotely) and processed via iterwalk function, a crash can be triggered.
    (CVE-2022-2309)

  - An issue was discovered in libxml2 before 2.10.3. When parsing a multi-gigabyte XML document with the     XML_PARSE_HUGE parser option enabled, several integer counters can overflow. This results in an attempt to     access an array at a negative 2GB offset, typically leading to a segmentation fault. (CVE-2022-40303)

  - An issue was discovered in libxml2 before 2.10.3. Certain invalid XML entity definitions can corrupt a     hash table key, potentially leading to subsequent logic errors. In one case, a double-free can be     provoked. (CVE-2022-40304)

  - The Keccak XKCP SHA-3 reference implementation before fdc6fef has an integer overflow and resultant buffer     overflow that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or eliminate expected cryptographic properties.
    This occurs in the sponge function interface. (CVE-2022-37454)

  - An issue was discovered in Python before 3.11.1. An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path     when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name     being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by     remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger     excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname.
    For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status     code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16. (CVE-2022-45061)

  - Protobuf-c v1.4.0 was discovered to contain an invalid arithmetic shift via the function     parse_tag_and_wiretype in protobuf-c/protobuf-c.c. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial     of Service (DoS) via unspecified vectors. (CVE-2022-33070)

  - In Sudo before 1.9.12p2, the sudoedit (aka -e) feature mishandles extra arguments passed in the user-     provided environment variables (SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR), allowing a local attacker to append     arbitrary entries to the list of files to process. This can lead to privilege escalation. Affected     versions are 1.8.0 through 1.9.12.p1. The problem exists because a user-specified editor may contain a
    -- argument that defeats a protection mechanism, e.g., an EDITOR='vim -- /path/to/extra/file' value.

  - A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint     checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to     have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite     failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which     could lead to a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private     memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working     exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client,     this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the     server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.8 (Affected     since 3.0.0). (CVE-2022-4203)

  - A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient     to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful     decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption.
    The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS     connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An     attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send     trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number     of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be     able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zg (Affected since     1.0.2). (CVE-2022-4304)

  - The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the name (e.g.
    CERTIFICATE), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the name_out,     header and data arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data.
    The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results     in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate     the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this     buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an     attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service     attack. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and     therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a     number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file()     which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the     caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations     include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL     asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.8 (Affected since     3.0.0). (CVE-2022-4450)

  - The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is     primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may     also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a     new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the     BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid,     the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this     case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal     pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then     a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the     internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call     BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions     PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream, SMIME_write_ASN1,     SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7. Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include     i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream. The OpenSSL     cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected. Thanks to Octavio Galland (Max Planck     Institute for Security and Privacy). Thanks to Marcel Bhme (Max Planck Institute for Security and     Privacy). Fix developed by Viktor Dukhovni. Fix developed by Matt Caswell. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1t     (Affected since 1.1.1).

  - An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to load malformed PKCS7     data with the d2i_PKCS7(), d2i_PKCS7_bio() or d2i_PKCS7_fp() functions. The result of the dereference is     an application crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL     does not call this function however third party applications might call these functions on untrusted data.
    Thanks to Marc Schnefeld. Fix developed by Tom Mrz. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.8 (Affected since 3.0.0).
    (CVE-2023-0216)

  - An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to check a malformed DSA     public key by the EVP_PKEY_public_check() function. This will most likely lead to an application crash.
    This function can be called on public keys supplied from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker     to cause a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function but     applications might call the function if there are additional security requirements imposed by standards     such as FIPS 140-3. Thanks to Kurt Roeckx. Fix developed by Shane Lontis from Oracle. Fixed in OpenSSL     3.0.8 (Affected since 3.0.0). (CVE-2023-0217)

  - There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName.
    X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME     incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently     interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL     checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may     allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or     enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate     chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these     inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is     uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented     their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network. Thanks to David Benjamin (Google). Fix     developed by Hugo Landau. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1t (Affected since 1.1.1). (CVE-2023-0286)

  - A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being verified on PKCS7 signed or     signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library     but the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the digest initialization will fail. There     is a missing check for the return value from the initialization function which later leads to invalid     usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash. The unavailability of an algorithm can be caused     by using FIPS enabled configuration of providers or more commonly by not loading the legacy provider.
    PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also by the time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS     implementation in OpenSSL does not call these functions however third party applications would be affected     if they call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted data. Thanks to Hubert Kario (Red Hat).
    Thanks to Dmitry Belyavsky (Red Hat). Fix developed by Tom Mrz. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.8 (Affected since     3.0.0). (CVE-2023-0401)

  - The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is     primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may     also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a     new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the     BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid,     the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this     case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal     pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then     a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the     internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call     BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions     PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream, SMIME_write_ASN1,     SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7. Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include     i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream. The OpenSSL     cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected. Thanks to Octavio Galland (Max Planck     Institute for Security and Privacy). Thanks to Marcel Bhme (Max Planck Institute for Security and     Privacy). Fix developed by Viktor Dukhovni. Fix developed by Matt Caswell. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1t     (Affected since 1.1.1).

  - There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName.
    X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME     incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently     interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL     checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may     allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or     enact a denial of service.

Information: Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute (NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on 32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature.  Enabling any feature that can protect against buffer overflow attacks enhances the security of the system.

NOTE: Virtualization hosts vary on how they expose host CPU flags to guest VMs. If this Nessus host is a virtual machine, consult your virtualization environment's documentation on how to expose host CPU flags to guest VMs.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution: On 32 bit systems install a kernel with PAE support, no installation is required on 64 bit systems: If necessary configure your bootloader to load the new kernel and reboot the system. You may need to enable NX or XD support in your bios.

Information: The INFO parameter specifies that login and logout activity will be logged.  SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. DEBUG is specifically not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it provides so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information.

Information: There are several options available to limit which users and group can access the system via SSH. It is recommended that at least one of the following options be leveraged: AllowUsers The AllowUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific users to ssh into the system. The list consists of space separated user names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict user access further by only allowing the allowed users to log in from a particular host, the entry can be specified in the form of user@host. AllowGroups The AllowGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific groups of users to ssh into the system. The list consists of space separated group names. Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable. DenyUsers The DenyUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific users to ssh into the system. The list consists of space separated user names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict user access further by specifically denying a user's access from a particular host, the entry can be specified in the form of user@host. DenyGroups The DenyGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific groups of users to ssh into the system. The list consists of space separated group names. Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable.  Restricting which users can remotely access the system via SSH will help ensure that only authorized users access the system.

Information: The PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to force passwords to expire once they reach a defined age. It is recommended that the PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter be set to less than or equal to 90 days.  The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials or successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack is limited by the age of the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum age of a password also reduces an attacker's window of opportunity.

Information: The PASS_MIN_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to prevent users from changing their password until a minimum number of days have passed since the last time the user changed their password. It is recommended that PASS_MIN_DAYS parameter be set to 7 or more days.

Information: System time should be synchronized between all systems in an environment. This is typically done by establishing an authoritative time server or set of servers and having all systems synchronize their clocks to them.  Time synchronization is important to support time sensitive security mechanisms like Kerberos and also ensures log files have consistent time records across the enterprise, which aids in forensic investigations.

Information: A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally used to determine why a program aborted. It can also be used to glean confidential information from a core file. The system provides the ability to set a soft limit for core dumps, but this can be overridden by the user.  Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the soft variable. If core dumps are required, consider setting limits for user groups (see limits.conf(5)). In addition, setting the fs.suid_dumpable variable to 0 will prevent setuid programs from dumping core.

Information: In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully specify the route packets take through a network. In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets would need to be used.  Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route and net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route to 0 disables the system from accepting source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If, however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing protocols that did not allow this routing.

Information: Setting net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts to 1 will cause the system to ignore all ICMP echo and timestamp requests to broadcast and multicast addresses.  Accepting ICMP echo and timestamp requests with broadcast or multicast destinations for your network could be used to trick your host into starting (or participating) in a Smurf attack. A Smurf attack relies on an attacker sending large amounts of ICMP broadcast messages with a spoofed source address. All hosts receiving this message and responding would send echo-reply messages back to the spoofed address, which is probably not routable. If many hosts respond to the packets, the amount of traffic on the network could be significantly multiplied.

Information: A default deny all policy on connections ensures that any unconfigured network usage will be rejected.  With a default accept policy the firewall will accept any packet that is not configured to be denied. It is easier to white list acceptable usage than to black list unacceptable usage.

Result: FAILED

Actual Value: The command '/sbin/iptables --list | /bin/grep 'Chain OUTPUT'' returned : 

bash: /sbin/iptables: No such file or directory

Policy Value: cmd: /sbin/iptables --list | /bin/grep 'Chain OUTPUT'
expect: ^Chain OUTPUT \(policy DROP\)
regex: ^Chain OUTPUT \(policy DROP\)
system: Linux

Solution: Run the following commands to implement a default DROP policy: # iptables -P INPUT DROP# iptables -P OUTPUT DROP# iptables -P FORWARD DROP

The guidance in the section ensures that remote log hosts are configured to only accept rsyslog data from hosts within the specified domain and that those systems that are not designed to be log hosts do not accept any remote rsyslog messages. This provides protection from spoofed log data and ensures that system administrators are reviewing reasonably complete syslog data in a central location.

Information: The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of ssh sessions. When the ClientAliveInterval variable is set, ssh sessions that have no activity for the specified length of time are terminated. When the ClientAliveCountMax variable is set, sshd will send client alive messages at every ClientAliveInterval interval. When the number of consecutive client alive messages are sent with no response from the client, the ssh session is terminated. For example, if the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15 seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be terminated after 45 seconds of idle time.  Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening.. While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on site policy.

Information: The su command allows a user to run a command or shell as another user. The program has been superseded by sudo, which allows for more granular control over privileged access. Normally, the su command can be executed by any user. By uncommenting the pam_wheel.so statement in /etc/pam.d/su, the su command will only allow users in the sudo group to execute su.  Restricting the use of su, and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed via sudo, whereas su can only record that a user executed the su program.

Information: A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally used to determine why a program aborted. It can also be used to glean confidential information from a core file. The system provides the ability to set a soft limit for core dumps, but this can be overridden by the user.  Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the soft variable. If core dumps are required, consider setting limits for user groups (see limits.conf(5)). In addition, setting the fs.suid_dumpable variable to 0 will prevent setuid programs from dumping core.

  - Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant     code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead     of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor     present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used     then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery     during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability     to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present     are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because     explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL     1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s). (CVE-2019-1547)

  - There is an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit     moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime     RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed     likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have     to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low     level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1e (Affected     1.1.1-1.1.1d). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2u (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2t). (CVE-2019-1551)

  - In situations where an attacker receives automated notification of the success or failure of a decryption     attempt an attacker, after sending a very large number of messages to be decrypted, can recover a     CMS/PKCS7 transported encryption key or decrypt any RSA encrypted message that was encrypted with the     public RSA key, using a Bleichenbacher padding oracle attack. Applications are not affected if they use a     certificate together with the private RSA key to the CMS_decrypt or PKCS7_decrypt functions to select the     correct recipient info to decrypt. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL     1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s). (CVE-2019-1563)

  - The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to     compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In     such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent     over that TLS connection. The attack can only be exploited if an implementation re-uses a DH secret across     multiple TLS connections. Note that this issue only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites.
    This issue affects OpenSSL 1.0.2 which is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. OpenSSL     1.1.1 is not vulnerable to this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2w (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2v). (CVE-2020-1968)

  - The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name     types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different     instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both     GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a     possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1)     Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in     an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp     authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an     attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if     the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL     then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a     certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified.
    OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the -crl_download option which implements     automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an     unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of     EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will     accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue.
    Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected     1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w). (CVE-2020-1971)

  - BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are configured to use GSS-TSIG     features. In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed,     but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or     tkey-gssapi-credentialconfiguration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-     TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server     environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. The most likely outcome     of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability is a crash of the named process. However, remote code     execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects: BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.11,     and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.27-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.11-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition.
    Also release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development branch (CVE-2020-8625)

  - The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based     on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly     handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is     maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a     potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by     OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on     certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources.

(CVE-2021-25214)

The vulnerability     affects all currently maintained BIND 9 branches (9.11, 9.11-S, 9.16, 9.16-S, 9.17) as well as all other     versions of BIND 9. (CVE-2021-25215)

  - In BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.29-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 ->     9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the BIND     9.17 development branch, BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are     configured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable     code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting values for the     tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential configuration options. Although the default configuration is     not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in     mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. For servers     that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on     the CPU architecture for which BIND was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this flaw     can be used to trigger a buffer over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for     32-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overflow and possibly     also to achieve remote code execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are     available in the MIT and Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems,     rendering the ISC implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for     BIND users, we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16     (it had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable ESV     (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO implementation,     we have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.

  - In the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.28, parse_reg_exp in posix/regcomp.c misparses     alternatives, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and application exit)     or trigger an incorrect result by attempting a regular-expression match. (CVE-2009-5155)

  - An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc     2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative     value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the     'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-     of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows     for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred.
    The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this     corrupted data. (CVE-2020-6096)

From inspection it is clear that the defect is also present in releases from     those series, but they have not been officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering     the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected     (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler     flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced     the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when     reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to     the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd     server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to     the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in     lack of service to clients. Additionally, the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in     the lease database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 64-bit     architecture OR if the -fstack-protection-strong compiler flag was NOT specified, the crash will not     occur, but it is possible for the offending lease and the lease which immediately followed it to be     improperly deleted.

  - ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a     buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings     which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not     a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own d2i functions (and other similar     parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will     additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for     applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array     by directly setting the data and length fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using     the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to     assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for     strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be     printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the     application without NUL terminating the data field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing     can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been     directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the     certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the     X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an     application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL     functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack).
    It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive     plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected     1.0.2-1.0.2y). (CVE-2021-3712)

  - A user can tell curl >= 7.20.0 and <= 7.78.0 to require a successful upgrade to TLS when speaking to an     IMAP, POP3 or FTP server (`--ssl-reqd` on the command line or`CURLOPT_USE_SSL` set to `CURLUSESSL_CONTROL`     or `CURLUSESSL_ALL` withlibcurl). This requirement could be bypassed if the server would return a properly     crafted but perfectly legitimate response.This flaw would then make curl silently continue its operations
    **withoutTLS** contrary to the instructions and expectations, exposing possibly sensitive data in clear     text over the network. (CVE-2021-22946)

  - When curl >= 7.20.0 and <= 7.78.0 connects to an IMAP or POP3 server to retrieve data using STARTTLS to     upgrade to TLS security, the server can respond and send back multiple responses at once that curl caches.
    curl would then upgrade to TLS but not flush the in-queue of cached responses but instead continue using     and trustingthe responses it got *before* the TLS handshake as if they were authenticated.Using this flaw,     it allows a Man-In-The-Middle attacker to first inject the fake responses, then pass-through the TLS     traffic from the legitimate server and trick curl into sending data back to the user thinking the     attacker's injected data comes from the TLS-protected server.

An attacker who controls a malicious HTTP     server that an HTTP client (such as web browser) connects to, could trigger a Regular Expression Denial of     Service (ReDOS) during an authentication request with a specially crafted payload that is sent by the     server to the client. The greatest threat that this flaw poses is to application availability.

  - In shadow before 4.5, the newusers tool could be made to manipulate internal data structures in ways     unintended by the authors. Malformed input may lead to crashes (with a buffer overflow or other memory     corruption) or other unspecified behaviors. This crosses a privilege boundary in, for example, certain     web-hosting environments in which a Control Panel allows an unprivileged user account to create     subaccounts. (CVE-2017-12424)

  - An issue was discovered in shadow 4.5. newgidmap (in shadow-utils) is setuid and allows an unprivileged     user to be placed in a user namespace where setgroups(2) is permitted. This allows an attacker to remove     themselves from a supplementary group, which may allow access to certain filesystem paths if the     administrator has used group blacklisting (e.g., chmod g-rwx) to restrict access to paths. This flaw     effectively reverts a security feature in the kernel (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups knob) to     prevent this sort of privilege escalation. (CVE-2018-7169)

  - The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop     forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain     elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point     encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has     invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the     certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a     denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they     can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients     consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking     certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from     subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that     use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS     issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate     which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the     public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-     signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue     affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the     15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected     1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc). (CVE-2022-0778)

  - A flaw was found in Python, specifically within the urllib.parse module. This module helps break Uniform     Resource Locator (URL) strings into components. The issue involves how the urlparse method does not     sanitize input and allows characters like '\r' and ' ' in the URL path. This flaw allows an attacker to     input a crafted URL, leading to injection attacks. This flaw affects Python versions prior to 3.10.0b1,     3.9.5, 3.8.11, 3.7.11 and 3.6.14. (CVE-2022-0391)

  - There's a flaw in Python 3's pydoc. A local or adjacent attacker who discovers or is able to convince     another local or adjacent user to start a pydoc server could access the server and use it to disclose     sensitive information belonging to the other user that they would not normally be able to access. The     highest risk of this flaw is to data confidentiality. This flaw affects Python versions before 3.8.9,     Python versions before 3.9.3 and Python versions before 3.10.0a7. (CVE-2021-3426)

  - A flaw was found in Python, specifically in the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client library in PASV     (passive) mode. The issue is how the FTP client trusts the host from the PASV response by default. This     flaw allows an attacker to set up a malicious FTP server that can trick FTP clients into connecting back     to a given IP address and port. This vulnerability could lead to FTP client scanning ports, which     otherwise would not have been possible. (CVE-2021-4189)

  - An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through 5.0 patch 11. By default, if     Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its     effective UID to its real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support     saved UID functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell     can use enable -f for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid()     and therefore regains privileges. However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.

  - A denial of service vulnerability was found in rsyslog in the imptcp module. An attacker could send a     specially crafted message to the imptcp socket, which would cause rsyslog to crash. Versions before 8.27.0     are vulnerable. (CVE-2018-16881)

  - An issue was discovered in Rsyslog v8.1908.0. contrib/pmaixforwardedfrom/pmaixforwardedfrom.c has a heap     overflow in the parser for AIX log messages. The parser tries to locate a log message delimiter (in this     case, a space or a colon) but fails to account for strings that do not satisfy this constraint. If the     string does not match, then the variable lenMsg will reach the value zero and will skip the sanity check     that detects invalid log messages. The message will then be considered valid, and the parser will eat up     the nonexistent colon delimiter. In doing so, it will decrement lenMsg, a signed integer, whose value was     zero and now becomes minus one. The following step in the parser is to shift left the contents of the     message. To do this, it will call memmove with the right pointers to the target and destination strings,     but the lenMsg will now be interpreted as a huge value, causing a heap overflow. (CVE-2019-17041)

  - Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap     buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other     malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But     there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read.
    While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the     octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence     of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote     exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing     modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`,     `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to     directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module     `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present     on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be     specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important     modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability. (CVE-2022-24903)

  - The c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection. This     script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such     operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of     the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.
    Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1o (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1n).
    Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2ze (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zd). (CVE-2022-1292)

  - The OPENSSL_LH_flush() function, which empties a hash table, contains a bug that breaks reuse of the     memory occuppied by the removed hash table entries. This function is used when decoding certificates or     keys. If a long lived process periodically decodes certificates or keys its memory usage will expand     without bounds and the process might be terminated by the operating system causing a denial of service.
    Also traversing the empty hash table entries will take increasingly more time. Typically such long lived     processes might be TLS clients or TLS servers configured to accept client certificate authentication. The     function was added in the OpenSSL 3.0 version thus older releases are not affected by the issue. Fixed in     OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). (CVE-2022-1473)

  - In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances     where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection     were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other     places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command     executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is     automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the     privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the     OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3). Fixed in     OpenSSL 1.1.1p (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1o). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zf (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2ze). (CVE-2022-2068)

  - When doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to     ask for data to send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle     previously was used to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback.

  - In ISC DHCP 4.4.0 -> 4.4.3, ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -> 4.1-ESV-R16-P1, when the function     option_code_hash_lookup() is called from add_option(), it increases the option's refcount field. However,     there is not a corresponding call to option_dereference() to decrement the refcount field. The function     add_option() is only used in server responses to lease query packets.

  - An issue was discovered in Python before 3.11.1. An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path     when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name     being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by     remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger     excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname.
    For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status     code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16. (CVE-2022-45061)

  - Heimdal before 7.7.1 allows attackers to cause a NULL pointer dereference in a SPNEGO acceptor via a     preferred_mech_type of GSS_C_NO_OID and a nonzero initial_response value to send_accept. (CVE-2021-44758)

  - A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in Samba within the GSSAPI unwrap_des() and     unwrap_des3() routines of Heimdal. The DES and Triple-DES decryption routines in the Heimdal GSSAPI     library allow a length-limited write buffer overflow on malloc() allocated memory when presented with a     maliciously small packet. This flaw allows a remote user to send specially crafted malicious data to the     application, possibly resulting in a denial of service (DoS) attack. (CVE-2022-3437)

  - PAC parsing in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.19.4 and 1.20.x before 1.20.1 has integer overflows that     may lead to remote code execution (in KDC, kadmind, or a GSS or Kerberos application server) on 32-bit     platforms (which have a resultant heap-based buffer overflow), and cause a denial of service on other     platforms. This occurs in krb5_pac_parse in lib/krb5/krb/pac.c. Heimdal before 7.7.1 has a similar bug.
    (CVE-2022-42898)

  - Heimdal before 7.7.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because of an invalid free in the     ASN.1 codec used by the Key Distribution Center (KDC). (CVE-2022-44640)

  - In Sudo before 1.9.12p2, the sudoedit (aka -e) feature mishandles extra arguments passed in the user-     provided environment variables (SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR), allowing a local attacker to append     arbitrary entries to the list of files to process. This can lead to privilege escalation. Affected     versions are 1.8.0 through 1.9.12.p1. The problem exists because a user-specified editor may contain a

  - The Linux-PAM package before 1.5.2-6.1 for openSUSE Tumbleweed allows authentication bypass for SSH     logins.

  - The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is     primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may     also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a     new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the     BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid,     the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this     case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal     pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then     a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the     internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call     BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions     PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream, SMIME_write_ASN1,     SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7. Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include     i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream. The OpenSSL     cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected. Thanks to Octavio Galland (Max Planck     Institute for Security and Privacy). Thanks to Marcel Bhme (Max Planck Institute for Security and     Privacy). Fix developed by Viktor Dukhovni. Fix developed by Matt Caswell. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1t     (Affected since 1.1.1). (CVE-2023-0215)

  - There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName.
    X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME     incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently     interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL     checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may     allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or     enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate     chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these     inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is     uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented     their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network. Thanks to David Benjamin (Google). Fix     developed by Hugo Landau. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1t (Affected since 1.1.1). (CVE-2023-0286)

  - curl 7.7 through 7.76.1 suffers from an information disclosure when the `-t` command line option, known as     `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS` in libcurl, is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers. Due to a     flaw in the option parser for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized     data from a stack based buffer to the server, resulting in potentially revealing sensitive internal     information to the server using a clear-text network protocol.

  - An off-by-one Error issue was discovered in Systemd in format_timespan() function of time-util.c. An     attacker could supply specific values for time and accuracy that leads to buffer overrun in     format_timespan(), leading to a Denial of Service. (CVE-2022-3821)

  - A vulnerability was found in systemd. This security flaw can cause a local information leak due to     systemd-coredump not respecting the fs.suid_dumpable kernel setting. (CVE-2022-4415)

  - systemd 250 and 251 allows local users to achieve a systemd-coredump deadlock by triggering a crash that     has a long backtrace. This occurs in parse_elf_object in shared/elf-util.c. The exploitation methodology     is to crash a binary calling the same function recursively, and put it in a deeply nested directory to     make its backtrace large enough to cause the deadlock. This must be done 16 times when MaxConnections=16     is set for the systemd/units/systemd-coredump.socket file. (CVE-2022-45873)

Information: Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute (NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on 32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature.  Enabling any feature that can protect against buffer overflow attacks enhances the security of the system.

      NOTE: Virtualization hosts vary on how they expose host CPU flags to guest VMs. If this Nessus host is a virtual machine, consult your virtualization environment's documentation on how to expose host CPU flags to guest VMs.

      NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution: On 32 bit systems install a kernel with PAE support, no installation is required on 64 bit systems: If necessary configure your bootloader to load the new kernel and reboot the system. You may need to enable NX or XD support in your bios.

Information: The LoginGraceTime parameter specifies the time allowed for successful authentication to the SSH server. The longer the Grace period is the more open unauthenticated connections can exist. Like other session controls in this session the Grace Period should be limited to appropriate organizational limits to ensure the service is available for needed access.  Setting the LoginGraceTime parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful brute force attacks to the SSH server. It will also limit the number of concurrent unauthenticated connections While the recommended setting is 60 seconds (1 Minute), set the number based on site policy.

Information: There are several options available to limit which users and group can access the system via SSH. It is recommended that at least one of the following options be leveraged: AllowUsers The AllowUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific users to ssh into the system. The list consists of comma separated user names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict user access further by only allowing the allowed users to log in from a particular host, the entry can be specified in the form of user@host. AllowGroups The AllowGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific groups of users to ssh into the system. The list consists of comma separated group names. Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable. DenyUsers The DenyUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific users to ssh into the system. The list consists of comma separated user names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict user access further by specifically denying a user's access from a particular host, the entry can be specified in the form of user@host. DenyGroups The DenyGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific groups of users to ssh into the system. The list consists of comma separated group names.

Information: System time should be synchronized between all systems in an environment. This is typically done by establishing an authoritative time server or set of servers and having all systems synchronize their clocks to them.  Time synchronization is important to support time sensitive security mechanisms like Kerberos and also ensures log files have consistent time records across the enterprise, which aids in forensic investigations.

Information: The system includes the capability of rotating log files regularly to avoid filling up the system with logs or making the logs unmanageable large. The file /etc/logrotate.d/syslog is the configuration file used to rotate log files created by syslog or rsyslog.  By keeping the log files smaller and more manageable, a system administrator can easily archive these files to another system and spend less time looking through inordinately large log files.

Information: A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally used to determine why a program aborted. It can also be used to glean confidential information from a core file. The system provides the ability to set a soft limit for core dumps, but this can be overridden by the user.  Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the soft variable. If core dumps are required, consider setting limits for user groups (see limits.conf(5)). In addition, setting the fs.suid_dumpable variable to 0 will prevent setuid programs from dumping core.

Information: Setting net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts to 1 will cause the system to ignore all ICMP echo and timestamp requests to broadcast and multicast addresses.  Accepting ICMP echo and timestamp requests with broadcast or multicast destinations for your network could be used to trick your host into starting (or participating) in a Smurf attack. A Smurf attack relies on an attacker sending large amounts of ICMP broadcast messages with a spoofed source address. All hosts receiving this message and responding would send echo-reply messages back to the spoofed address, which is probably not routable. If many hosts respond to the packets, the amount of traffic on the network could be significantly multiplied.

Information: The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of ssh sessions. When the ClientAliveInterval variable is set, ssh sessions that have no activity for the specified length of time are terminated. When the ClientAliveCountMax variable is set, sshd will send client alive messages at every ClientAliveInterval interval. When the number of consecutive client alive messages are sent with no response from the client, the ssh session is terminated. For example, if the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15 seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be terminated after 45 seconds of idle time.  Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening.. While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on site policy. The recommended setting for ClientAliveCountMax is 0. In this case, the client session will be terminated after 5 minutes of idle time and no keepalive messages will be sent.

Information: The pam_pwquality.so module checks the strength of passwords. It performs checks such as making sure a password is not a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains a mix of characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more. The following are definitions of the pam_pwquality.so options. try_first_pass - retrieve the password from a previous stacked PAM module. If not available, then prompt the user for a password. retry=3 - Allow 3 tries before sending back a failure. The following options are set in the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file: minlen=14 - password must be 14 characters or more dcredit=-1 - provide at least one digit ucredit=-1 - provide at least one uppercase character ocredit=-1 - provide at least one special character lcredit=-1 - provide at least one lowercase character The settings shown above are one possible policy. Alter these values to conform to your own organization's password policies.  Strong passwords protect systems from being hacked through brute force methods.

Information: The PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to force passwords to expire once they reach a defined age. It is recommended that the PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter be set to less than or equal to 90 days.  The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials or successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack is limited by the age of the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum age of a password also reduces an attacker's window of opportunity.

Information: The su command allows a user to run a command or shell as another user. The program has been superseded by sudo, which allows for more granular control over privileged access. Normally, the su command can be executed by any user. By uncommenting the pam_wheel.so statement in /etc/pam.d/su, the su command will only allow users in the wheel group to execute su.  Restricting the use of su, and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed via sudo, whereas su can only record that a user executed the su program.
