A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.\n\nThis flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hardcoded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library.

remote host is running a TCP-based .NET Remoting Channel Service, aka a \u0026apos;TCP channel\u0026apos;.  .NET Remoting is an API developed by Microsoft and used for interprocess communications, and a channel service provides the mechanism by which such communications occur.  Two channel services are supplied as part of Microsoft\u0026apos;s .NET Framework - a TCP channel, which uses binary payloads, and an HTTP channel, which uses SOAP by default.","plugin.family":"Service detection","plugin.id":"24018","plugin.name":"TCP Channel Detection","plugin.riskFactor":"None","plugin.seeAlso":"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/72x4h507.aspx\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Remoting","plugin.solution":"Limit incoming traffic to this port if desired.","plugin.synopsis":"A TCP channel is listening on the remote host.","plugin.type":"remote","plugin.version":"$Revision: 1.8 $","port.port":"7001","port.protocol":"tcp","port.service":"remoting_tcp","severityID":"0"},"id":"1e090dff-c108-4a1e-b199-8a668e9475b3","created_at":1674195670,"updated_at":1674195670,"organization_id":"16342112-ce91-47ea-9e86-edb4993f135c","site_id":"e19385b0-f689-4228-83e4-391aaa638367","alive":false,"last_seen":0,"first_seen":0,"detected_by":"Tenable","type":"Server","os_vendor":"Microsoft","os_product":"Windows Server 2008 R2","os_version":"Service Pack 1","os":"Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2","hw_vendor":"","hw_product":"","hw_version":"","hw":"VMware VM","addresses":["10.31.112.22"],"addresses_extra":[],"macs":["00:50:56:81:01:db"],"mac_vendors":["VMware, Inc."],"names":["QA3APP02"],"tags":{},"domains":[],"services":{},"credentials":{},"rtts":{},"attributes":{"_macs.ipmap":"00:50:56:81:01:db=10.31.112.22","fp.certainty":"0.85","match.db":"operating-system","match.probe":"tenable","match.score":"00","match.score.hw":"00","match.score.os":"85","os.certainty":"0.0","os.edition":"Standard","os.family":"Windows","os.product":"Windows Server 2008 R2","os.vendor":"Microsoft","os.version":"Service Pack 1","virtual":"VMware"},"service_count":0,"service_count_tcp":0,"service_count_udp":0,"service_count_arp":0,"service_count_icmp":0,"software_count":0,"vulnerability_count":45,"lowest_ttl":null,"lowest_rtt":null,"last_agent_id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","last_task_id":"c8b7976d-eb75-4642-8b48-36704bbbce5d","newest_mac":"00:50:56:81:01:db","newest_mac_vendor":"VMware, Inc.","newest_mac_age":null,"comments":null,"service_ports_tcp":null,"service_ports_udp":null,"service_protocols":null,"service_products":null,"scanned":false,"source_ids":[10],"eol_os":1421107200,"eol_os_ext":1578960000,"outlier_score":0,"outlier_raw":0,"ownership":{"Map":{}},"owners":[],"org_name":"ArmorCode","site_name":"Primary","agent_name":null},{"vulnerability_id":"66996194-601d-4345-9016-3a70ac90e801","vulnerability_asset_id":"1e090dff-c108-4a1e-b199-8a668e9475b3","vulnerability_organization_id":"16342112-ce91-47ea-9e86-edb4993f135c","vulnerability_source_id":10,"vulnerability_created_at":1674195670,"vulnerability_updated_at":1674195670,"vulnerability_service_address":"10.31.112.22","vulnerability_service_transport":"tcp","vulnerability_service_port":445,"vulnerability_cpe23":"cpe:/o:microsoft:windows","vulnerability_vuln_id":"57608","vulnerability_category":"Remote","vulnerability_name":"SMB Signing Disabled","vulnerability_description":"Signing is disabled on the remote SMB server.","vulnerability_solution":"Enforce message signing in the host\u0026apos;s configuration.

A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.\n\nThis flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hardcoded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library.

A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.\n\nThis flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hardcoded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library.

A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.\n\nThis flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hardcoded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library.
