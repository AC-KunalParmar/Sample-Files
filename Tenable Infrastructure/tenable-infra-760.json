It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2022-04 advisory.\n\n  - A Time-of-Check Time-of-Use bug existed in the Maintenance (Updater) Service that could be abused to grant     Users write access to an arbitrary directory. This could have been used to escalate to SYSTEM access. This     bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-22753)\n\n  - If a user installed an extension of a particular type, the extension could have auto-updated itself and     while doing so, bypass the prompt which grants the new version the new requested permissions.\n    (CVE-2022-22754)\n\n  - By using XSL Transforms, a malicious webserver could have served a user an XSL document that would     continue to execute JavaScript (within the bounds of the same-origin policy) even after the tab was     closed. (CVE-2022-22755)\n\n  - If a user was convinced to drag and drop an image to their desktop or other folder, the resulting object     could have been changed into an executable script which would have run arbitrary code after the user     clicked on it. (CVE-2022-22756)\n\n  - Remote Agent, used in WebDriver, did not validate the Host or Origin headers. This could have allowed     websites to connect back locally to the user's browser to control it.  This bug only affected Firefox when     WebDriver was enabled, which is not the default configuration. (CVE-2022-22757)\n\n  - When clicking on a tel: link, USSD codes, specified after a <code></code> character, would be included in     the phone number.  On certain phones, or on certain carriers, if the number was dialed this could perform     actions on a user's account, similar to a cross-site request forgery attack. This bug only affects Firefox     for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-22758)\n\n  - If a document created a sandboxed iframe without <code>allow-scripts</code>, and subsequently appended an     element to the iframe's document that e.g. had a JavaScript event handler - the event handler would have     run despite the iframe's sandbox. (CVE-2022-22759)\n\n  - When importing resources using Web Workers, error messages would distinguish the difference between     <code>application/javascript</code> responses and non-script responses.  This could have been abused to     learn information cross-origin. (CVE-2022-22760)\n\n  - Web-accessible extension pages (pages with a moz-extension:// scheme) were not correctly enforcing the     frame-ancestors directive when it was used in the Web Extension's Content Security Policy.\n    (CVE-2022-22761)\n\n  - Under certain circumstances, a JavaScript alert (or prompt) could have been shown while another website     was displayed underneath it. This could have been abused to trick the user.  This bug only affects Firefox     for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-22762)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Paul Adenot and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox     96 and Firefox ESR 91.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with     enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

Users whose accounts are configured to have     fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted     than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n    (CVE-2020-0646)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in .NET     software when the software fails to check the source     markup of a file. An attacker who successfully exploited     the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the     context of the current user. If the current user is     logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker     could take control of the affected system. An attacker     could then install programs; view, change, or delete     data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\n    (CVE-2020-0605,

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2023-01 advisory.\n\n  - A compromised web child process could disable web security opening restrictions, leading to a new child     process being spawned within the <code>file://</code> context. Given a reliable exploit primitive, this     new process could be exploited again leading to arbitrary file read. (CVE-2023-23597)\n\n  - Due to the Firefox GTK wrapper code's use of text/plain for drag data and GTK treating all text/plain     MIMEs containing file URLs as being dragged a website could arbitrarily read a file via a call to     <code>DataTransfer.setData</code>. (CVE-2023-23598)\n\n  - When copying a network request from the developer tools panel as a curl command the output was not being     properly sanitized and could allow arbitrary commands to be hidden within. (CVE-2023-23599)\n\n  - Per origin notification permissions were being stored in a way that didn't take into account what browsing     context the permission was granted in. This lead to the possibility of notifications to be displayed     during different browsing sessions. This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are     unaffected. (CVE-2023-23600)\n\n  - Navigations were being allowed when dragging a URL from a cross-origin iframe into the same tab which     could lead to website spoofing attacks (CVE-2023-23601)\n\n  - A mishandled security check when creating a WebSocket in a WebWorker caused the Content Security Policy     connect-src header to be ignored. This could lead to connections to restricted origins from inside     WebWorkers. (CVE-2023-23602)\n\n  - Regular expressions used to filter out forbidden properties and values from style directives in calls to     <code>console.log</code> weren't accounting for external URLs. Data could then be potentially exfiltrated     from the browser. (CVE-2023-23603)\n\n  - A duplicate <code>SystemPrincipal</code> object could be created when parsing a non-system html document     via <code>DOMParser::ParseFromSafeString</code>. This could have lead to bypassing web security checks.\n    (CVE-2023-23604)\n\n  - Mozilla developers and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 108 and     Firefox ESR 102.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough     effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

remote Windows host is prior to 109.0. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2023-01 advisory.\n\n  - A compromised web child process could disable web security opening restrictions, leading to a new child     process being spawned within the <code>file://</code> context. Given a reliable exploit primitive, this     new process could be exploited again leading to arbitrary file read. (CVE-2023-23597)\n\n  - Due to the Firefox GTK wrapper code's use of text/plain for drag data and GTK treating all text/plain     MIMEs containing file URLs as being dragged a website could arbitrarily read a file via a call to     <code>DataTransfer.setData</code>. (CVE-2023-23598)\n\n  - When copying a network request from the developer tools panel as a curl command the output was not being     properly sanitized and could allow arbitrary commands to be hidden within. (CVE-2023-23599)\n\n  - Per origin notification permissions were being stored in a way that didn't take into account what browsing     context the permission was granted in. This lead to the possibility of notifications to be displayed     during different browsing sessions. This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are     unaffected. (CVE-2023-23600)\n\n  - Navigations were being allowed when dragging a URL from a cross-origin iframe into the same tab which     could lead to website spoofing attacks (CVE-2023-23601)\n\n  - A mishandled security check when creating a WebSocket in a WebWorker caused the Content Security Policy     connect-src header to be ignored. This could lead to connections to restricted origins from inside     WebWorkers. (CVE-2023-23602)\n\n  - Regular expressions used to filter out forbidden properties and values from style directives in calls to     <code>console.log</code> weren't accounting for external URLs. Data could then be potentially exfiltrated     from the browser. (CVE-2023-23603)\n\n  - A duplicate <code>SystemPrincipal</code> object could be created when parsing a non-system html document     via <code>DOMParser::ParseFromSafeString</code>. This could have lead to bypassing web security checks.\n    (CVE-2023-23604)\n\n  - Mozilla developers and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 108 and     Firefox ESR 102.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough     effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2022-47 advisory.\n\n  - Service Workers should not be able to infer information about opaque cross-origin responses; but timing     information for cross-origin media combined with Range requests might have allowed them to determine the     presence or length of a media file. (CVE-2022-45403)\n\n  - Through a series of popup and <code>window.print()</code> calls, an attacker can cause a window to go     fullscreen without the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in potential user confusion or     spoofing attacks. (CVE-2022-45404)\n\n  - Freeing arbitrary <code>nsIInputStream</code>'s on a different thread than creation could have led to a     use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-45405)\n\n  - If an out-of-memory condition occurred when creating a JavaScript global, a JavaScript realm may be     deleted while references to it lived on in a BaseShape. This could lead to a use-after-free causing a     potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-45406)\n\n  - If an attacker loaded a font using <code>FontFace()</code> on a background worker, a use-after-free could     have occurred, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-45407)\n\n  - Through a series of popups that reuse windowName, an attacker can cause a window to go fullscreen without     the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.\n    (CVE-2022-45408)\n\n  - The garbage collector could have been aborted in several states and zones and     <code>GCRuntime::finishCollection</code> may not have been called, leading to a use-after-free and     potentially exploitable crash (CVE-2022-45409)\n\n  - When a ServiceWorker intercepted a request with <code>FetchEvent</code>, the origin of the request was     lost after the ServiceWorker took ownership of it.  This had the effect of negating SameSite cookie     protections.  This was addressed in the spec and then in browsers. (CVE-2022-45410)\n\n  - Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method, allowing an XSS     attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies     protected by HTTPOnly).  To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and     XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-     Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again.  Firefox has applied     the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. (CVE-2022-45411)\n\n  - When resolving a symlink such as <code>file:///proc/self/fd/1</code>, an error message may be produced     where the symlink was resolved to a string containing unitialized memory in the buffer.  This bug only     affects Firefox on Unix-based operated systems (Android, Linux, MacOS). Windows is unaffected.\n    (CVE-2022-45412)\n\n  - Using the <code>S.browserfallbackurl parameter</code> parameter, an attacker could redirect a user to a     URL and cause SameSite=Strict cookies to be sent. This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other     operating systems are not affected. (CVE-2022-45413)\n\n  - A flaw in XML parsing could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. In     official releases of Firefox this vulnerability is mitigated by wasm sandboxing; versions managed by Linux     distributions may have other settings. (CVE-2022-40674)\n\n  - When downloading an HTML file, if the title of the page was formatted as a filename with a malicious     extension, Firefox may have saved the file with that extension, leading to possible system compromise if     the downloaded file was later ran. (CVE-2022-45415)\n\n  - Keyboard events reference strings like KeyA that were at fixed, known, and widely-spread addresses.\n    Cache-based timing attacks such as Prime+Probe could have possibly figured out which keys were being     pressed. (CVE-2022-45416)\n\n  - Service Workers did not detect Private Browsing Mode correctly in all cases, which could have led to     Service Workers being written to disk for websites visited in Private Browsing Mode.  This would not have     persisted them in a state where they would run again, but it would have leaked Private Browsing Mode     details to disk. (CVE-2022-45417)\n\n  - If a custom mouse cursor is specified in CSS, under certain circumstances the cursor could have been drawn     over the browser UI, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks. (CVE-2022-45418)\n\n  - If the user added a security exception for an invalid TLS certificate, opened an ongoing TLS connection     with a server that used that certificate, and then deleted the exception, Firefox would have kept the     connection alive, making it seem like the certificate was still trusted. (CVE-2022-45419)\n\n  - Using tables inside of an iframe, an attacker could have caused iframe contents to be rendered outside the     boundaries of the iframe, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.

(CVE-2023-25728)\n\n  - A background script invoking <code>requestFullscreen</code> and then blocking the main thread could force     the browser into fullscreen mode indefinitely, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.\n    (CVE-2023-25730)\n\n  - A lack of in app notification for entering fullscreen mode could have lead to a malicious website spoofing     browser chrome. This bug only affects Firefox Focus. Other versions of Firefox are unaffected.\n    (CVE-2023-25743)\n\n  - An attacker could construct a PKCS 12 cert bundle in such a way that could allow for arbitrary memory     writes via PKCS 12 Safe Bag attributes being mishandled. (CVE-2023-0767)\n\n  - Cross-compartment wrappers wrapping a scripted proxy could have caused objects from other compartments to     be stored in the main compartment resulting in a use-after-free after unwrapping the proxy.\n    (CVE-2023-25735)\n\n  - An invalid downcast from <code>nsTextNode</code> to <code>SVGElement</code> could have lead to undefined     behavior. (CVE-2023-25737)\n\n  - Members of the <code>DEVMODEW</code> struct set by the printer device driver weren't being validated and     could have resulted in invalid values which in turn would cause the browser to attempt out of bounds     access to related variables. This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are     unaffected. (CVE-2023-25738)\n\n  - Module load requests that failed were not being checked as to whether or not they were cancelled causing a     use-after-free in <code>ScriptLoadContext</code>. (CVE-2023-25739)\n\n  - Permission prompts for opening external schemes were only shown for <code>ContentPrincipals</code>     resulting in extensions being able to open them without user interaction via     <code>ExpandedPrincipals</code>. This could lead to further malicious actions such as downloading files or     interacting with software already installed on the system. (CVE-2023-25729)\n\n  - When encoding data from an <code>inputStream</code> in <code>xpcom</code> the size of the input being     encoded was not correctly calculated potentially leading to an out of bounds memory write.\n    (CVE-2023-25732)\n\n  - After downloading a Windows <code>.url</code> shortcut from the local filesystem, an attacker could supply     a remote path that would lead to unexpected network requests from the operating system.  This also had the     potential to leak NTLM credentials to the resource. This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other     operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2023-25734)\n\n  - After downloading a Windows <code>.scf</code> script from the local filesystem, an attacker could supply a     remote path that would lead to unexpected network requests from the operating system. This also had the     potential to leak NTLM credentials to the resource. This bug only affects Firefox for Windows. Other     operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2023-25740)\n\n  - Due to URL previews in the network panel of developer tools improperly storing URLs, query parameters     could potentially be used to overwrite global objects in privileged code. (CVE-2023-25731)\n\n  - The return value from <code>gfx::SourceSurfaceSkia::Map()</code> wasn't being verified which could have     potentially lead to a null pointer dereference. (CVE-2023-25733)\n\n  - An invalid downcast from <code>nsHTMLDocument</code> to <code>nsIContent</code> could have lead to     undefined behavior. (CVE-2023-25736)\n\n  - When dragging and dropping an image cross-origin, the image's size could potentially be leaked. This     behavior was shipped in 109 and caused web compatibility problems as well as this security concern, so the     behavior was disabled until further review. (CVE-2023-25741)\n\n  - When importing a SPKI RSA public key as ECDSA P-256, the key would be handled incorrectly causing the tab     to crash. (CVE-2023-25742)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Kershaw Chang and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in     Firefox 109 and Firefox ESR 102.7.

(CVE-2023-25728)\n\n  - A background script invoking <code>requestFullscreen</code> and then blocking the main thread could force     the browser into fullscreen mode indefinitely, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.\n    (CVE-2023-25730)\n\n  - A lack of in app notification for entering fullscreen mode could have lead to a malicious website spoofing     browser chrome. This bug only affects Firefox Focus. Other versions of Firefox are unaffected.\n    (CVE-2023-25743)\n\n  - An attacker could construct a PKCS 12 cert bundle in such a way that could allow for arbitrary memory     writes via PKCS 12 Safe Bag attributes being mishandled. (CVE-2023-0767)\n\n  - Cross-compartment wrappers wrapping a scripted proxy could have caused objects from other compartments to     be stored in the main compartment resulting in a use-after-free after unwrapping the proxy.\n    (CVE-2023-25735)\n\n  - An invalid downcast from <code>nsTextNode</code> to <code>SVGElement</code> could have lead to undefined     behavior. (CVE-2023-25737)\n\n  - Members of the <code>DEVMODEW</code> struct set by the printer device driver weren't being validated and     could have resulted in invalid values which in turn would cause the browser to attempt out of bounds     access to related variables. This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are     unaffected.

(CVE-2023-25733)\n\n  - An invalid downcast from <code>nsHTMLDocument</code> to <code>nsIContent</code> could have lead to     undefined behavior. (CVE-2023-25736)\n\n  - When dragging and dropping an image cross-origin, the image's size could potentially be leaked. This     behavior was shipped in 109 and caused web compatibility problems as well as this security concern, so the     behavior was disabled until further review. (CVE-2023-25741)\n\n  - When importing a SPKI RSA public key as ECDSA P-256, the key would be handled incorrectly causing the tab     to crash. (CVE-2023-25742)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Kershaw Chang and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in     Firefox 109 and Firefox ESR 102.7.

This bug only affects Firefox for Linux. Other operating systems     are unaffected. (CVE-2022-46872)\n\n  - Because Firefox did not implement the <code>unsafe-hashes</code> CSP directive, an attacker who was able     to inject markup into a page otherwise protected by a Content Security Policy may have been able to inject     executable script.  This would be severely constrained by the specified Content Security Policy of the     document. (CVE-2022-46873)\n\n  - A file with a long filename could have had its filename truncated to remove the valid extension, leaving a     malicious extension in its place.

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2023-01 advisory.\n\n  - A compromised web child process could disable web security opening restrictions, leading to a new child     process being spawned within the <code>file://</code> context. Given a reliable exploit primitive, this     new process could be exploited again leading to arbitrary file read. (CVE-2023-23597)\n\n  - Due to the Firefox GTK wrapper code's use of text/plain for drag data and GTK treating all text/plain     MIMEs containing file URLs as being dragged a website could arbitrarily read a file via a call to     <code>DataTransfer.setData</code>. (CVE-2023-23598)\n\n  - When copying a network request from the developer tools panel as a curl command the output was not being     properly sanitized and could allow arbitrary commands to be hidden within. (CVE-2023-23599)\n\n  - Per origin notification permissions were being stored in a way that didn't take into account what browsing     context the permission was granted in. This lead to the possibility of notifications to be displayed     during different browsing sessions. This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are     unaffected. (CVE-2023-23600)\n\n  - Navigations were being allowed when dragging a URL from a cross-origin iframe into the same tab which     could lead to website spoofing attacks (CVE-2023-23601)\n\n  - A mishandled security check when creating a WebSocket in a WebWorker caused the Content Security Policy     connect-src header to be ignored. This could lead to connections to restricted origins from inside     WebWorkers. (CVE-2023-23602)\n\n  - Regular expressions used to filter out forbidden properties and values from style directives in calls to     <code>console.log</code> weren't accounting for external URLs. Data could then be potentially exfiltrated     from the browser. (CVE-2023-23603)\n\n  - A duplicate <code>SystemPrincipal</code> object could be created when parsing a non-system html document     via <code>DOMParser::ParseFromSafeString</code>. This could have lead to bypassing web security checks.\n    (CVE-2023-23604)\n\n  - Mozilla developers and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 108 and     Firefox ESR 102.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough     effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

remote Windows host is prior to 96.0. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2022-01 advisory.\n\n  - A race condition could have allowed bypassing the fullscreen notification which could have lead to a     fullscreen window spoof being unnoticed. This bug only affects Firefox for Windows. Other operating     systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-22746)\n\n  - When navigating from inside an iframe while requesting fullscreen access, an attacker-controlled tab could     have made the browser unable to leave fullscreen mode. (CVE-2022-22743)\n\n  - When inserting text while in edit mode, some characters might have lead to out-of-bounds memory access     causing a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-22742)\n\n  - When resizing a popup while requesting fullscreen access, the popup would have become unable to leave     fullscreen mode. (CVE-2022-22741)\n\n  - Certain network request objects were freed too early when releasing a network request handle. This could     have lead to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-22740)\n\n  - Applying a CSS filter effect could have accessed out of bounds memory. This could have lead to a heap-     buffer-overflow causing a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-22738)\n\n  - Constructing audio sinks could have lead to a race condition when playing audio files and closing windows.\n    This could have lead to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-22737)\n\n  - It was possible to construct specific XSLT markup that would be able to bypass an iframe sandbox.\n    (CVE-2021-4140)\n\n  - By generally accepting and passing resource handles across processes, a compromised content process might     have confused higher privileged processes to interact with handles that the unprivileged process should     not have access to. This bug only affects Firefox for Windows and MacOS. Other operating systems are     unaffected. (CVE-2022-22750)\n\n  - When scanning QR codes, Firefox for Android would have allowed navigation to some URLs that do not point     to web content. This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.\n    (CVE-2022-22749)\n\n  - Malicious websites could have confused Firefox into showing the wrong origin when asking to launch a     program and handling an external URL protocol. (CVE-2022-22748)\n\n  - Securitypolicyviolation events could have leaked cross-origin information for frame-ancestors violations     (CVE-2022-22745)\n\n  - The constructed curl command from the Copy as curl feature in DevTools was not properly escaped for     PowerShell.  This could have lead to command injection if pasted into a Powershell prompt. This bug only     affects Firefox for Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-22744)\n\n  - After accepting an untrusted certificate, handling an empty pkcs7 sequence as part of the certificate data     could have lead to a crash. This crash is believed to be unexploitable. (CVE-2022-22747)\n\n  - If Firefox was installed to a world-writable directory, a local privilege escalation could occur when     Firefox searched the current directory for system libraries. However the install directory is not world-     writable by default. This bug only affects Firefox for Windows in a non-default installation. Other     operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-22736)\n\n  - Malicious websites could have tricked users into accepting launching a program to handle an external URL     protocol. (CVE-2022-22739)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Calixte Denizet, Kershaw Chang, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Gabriele Svelto, Tyson     Smith, Simon Giesecke, and Steve Fink reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 95 and Firefox ESR     91.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some     of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-22751)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Christian Holler and Jason Kratzer reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 95.\n    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of     these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the     Windows kernel improperly handles objects in memory. An     attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability     could obtain information to further compromise the users     system.  (CVE-2019-0536, CVE-2019-0549, CVE-2019-0554)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way     that the Chakra scripting engine handles objects in     memory in Microsoft Edge. The vulnerability could     corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could     execute arbitrary code in the context of the current     user. An attacker who successfully exploited the     vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the     current user.  (CVE-2019-0539, CVE-2019-0567)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when     Windows Subsystem for Linux improperly handles objects     in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this     vulnerability could obtain information to further     compromise the users system. A attacker could exploit     this vulnerability by running a specially crafted     application. The update addresses the vulnerability by     correcting how Windows Subsystem for Linux handles     objects in memory. (CVE-2019-0553)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in .NET     Framework and .NET Core which allows bypassing Cross-     origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configurations. An     attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability     could retrieve content, that is normally restricted,     from a web application. The security update addresses     the vulnerability by enforcing CORS configuration to     prevent its bypass. (CVE-2019-0545)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the     Windows Jet Database Engine improperly handles objects     in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this     vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on a victim     system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by     enticing a victim to open a specially crafted file. The     update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way     the Windows Jet Database Engine handles objects in     memory. (CVE-2019-0538, CVE-2019-0575, CVE-2019-0576,     CVE-2019-0577, CVE-2019-0578, CVE-2019-0579,     CVE-2019-0580, CVE-2019-0581, CVE-2019-0582,     CVE-2019-0583, CVE-2019-0584)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the     Microsoft XmlDocument class that could allow an attacker     to escape from the AppContainer sandbox in the browser.\n    An attacker who successfully exploited this     vulnerability could gain elevated privileges and break     out of the Edge AppContainer sandbox. The vulnerability     by itself does not allow arbitrary code to run. However,     this vulnerability could be used in conjunction with one     or more vulnerabilities (for example a remote code     execution vulnerability and another elevation of     privilege vulnerability) to take advantage of the     elevated privileges when running. The security update     addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the     Microsoft XmlDocument class enforces sandboxing.\n    (CVE-2019-0555)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when     Windows improperly handles authentication requests. An     attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability     could run processes in an elevated context. An attacker     could exploit this vulnerability by running a specially     crafted application on the victim system. The update     addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way     Windows handles authentication requests. (CVE-2019-0543)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the     Windows Runtime improperly handles objects in memory. An     attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability     could run arbitrary code in an elevated context. An     attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a     specially crafted application on the victim system. The     update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way     the Windows Runtime handles objects in memory.\n    (CVE-2019-0570)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way     that the MSHTML engine inproperly validates input. An     attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of     the current user.  (CVE-2019-0541)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when     Windows Hyper-V on a host server fails to properly     validate input from an authenticated user on a guest     operating system.  (CVE-2019-0551)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege exists in Windows COM Desktop     Broker. An attacker who successfully exploited the     vulnerability could run arbitrary code with elevated     privileges.  (CVE-2019-0552)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in     Microsoft Edge Browser Broker COM object. An attacker     who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use     the Browser Broker COM object to elevate privileges on     an affected system. This vulnerability by itself does     not allow arbitrary code execution; however, it could     allow arbitrary code to be run if the attacker uses it     in combination with another vulnerability (such as a     remote code execution vulnerability or another elevation     of privilege vulnerability) that is capable of     leveraging the elevated privileges when code execution     is attempted. (CVE-2019-0566)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the     Windows kernel improperly handles objects in memory. An     attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability     could obtain information to further compromise the users     system. An authenticated attacker could exploit this     vulnerability by running a specially crafted     application. The update addresses the vulnerability by     correcting how the Windows kernel handles objects in     memory. (CVE-2019-0569)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the     Windows Data Sharing Service improperly handles file     operations. An attacker who successfully exploited this     vulnerability could run processes in an elevated     context. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by     running a specially crafted application on the victim     system.

This bug only affected Firefox when accessibility was enabled. (CVE-2021-29970)\n\n  - If a user had granted a permission to a webpage and saved that grant, any webpage running on the same host\n    - irrespective of scheme or port - would be granted that permission.This bug only affects Firefox for     Android. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2021-29971)\n\n  - An out of bounds write in ANGLE could have allowed an attacker to corrupt memory leading to a potentially     exploitable crash. (CVE-2021-30547)\n\n  - A user-after-free vulnerability was found via testing, and traced to an out-of-date Cairo library.\n    Updating the library resolved the issue, and may have remediated other, unknown security vulnerabilities     as well. (CVE-2021-29972)\n\n  - Password autofill was enabled without user interaction on insecure websites on Firefox for Android. This     was corrected to require user interaction with the page before a user's password would be entered by the     browser's autofill functionality.This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems     are unaffected. (CVE-2021-29973)\n\n  - When network partitioning was enabled, e.g. as a result of Enhanced Tracking Protection settings, a TLS     error page would allow the user to override an error on a domain which had specified HTTP Strict Transport     Security (which implies that the error should not be override-able.) This issue did not affect the network     connections, and they were correctly upgraded to HTTPS automatically. (CVE-2021-29974)\n\n  - Through a series of DOM manipulations, a message, over which the attacker had control of the text but not     HTML or formatting, could be overlaid on top of another domain (with the new domain correctly shown in the     address bar) resulting in possible user confusion. (CVE-2021-29975)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Emil Ghitta, Tyson Smith, Valentin Gosu, Olli Pettay, and Randell Jesup reported memory     safety bugs present in Firefox 89 and Firefox ESR 78.11. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory     corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary     code.

This bug only affects Firefox for Android.\n    Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2023-25748)\n\n  - Android applications with unpatched vulnerabilities can be launched from a browser using Intents, exposing     users to these vulnerabilities. Firefox will now confirm with users that they want to launch an external     application before doing so.  This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other versions of Firefox are     unaffected. (CVE-2023-25749)\n\n  - Under certain circumstances, a ServiceWorker's offline cache may have leaked to the file system when using     private browsing mode. (CVE-2023-25750)\n\n  - Sometimes, when invalidating JIT code while following an iterator, the newly generated code could be     overwritten incorrectly. This could lead to a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2023-25751)\n\n  - When following a redirect to a publicly accessible web extension file, the URL may have been translated to     the actual local path, leaking potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2023-28160)\n\n  - Dragging a URL from a cross-origin iframe that was removed during the drag could have lead to user     confusion and website spoofing attacks. (CVE-2023-28164)\n\n  - If temporary one-time permissions, such as the ability to use the Camera, were granted to a document     loaded using a file: URL, that permission persisted in that tab for all other documents loaded from a     file: URL. This is potentially dangerous if the local files came from different sources, such as in a     download directory.

(CVE-2023-28162)\n\n  - When accessing throttled streams, the count of available bytes needed to be checked in the calling     function to be within bounds. This may have lead future code to be incorrect and vulnerable.\n    (CVE-2023-25752)\n\n  - When downloading files through the Save As dialog on Windows with suggested filenames containing     environment variable names, Windows would have resolved those in the context of the current user.

(CVE-2023-25751)\n\n  - When following a redirect to a publicly accessible web extension file, the URL may have been translated to     the actual local path, leaking potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2023-28160)\n\n  - Dragging a URL from a cross-origin iframe that was removed during the drag could have lead to user     confusion and website spoofing attacks. (CVE-2023-28164)\n\n  - If temporary one-time permissions, such as the ability to use the Camera, were granted to a document     loaded using a file: URL, that permission persisted in that tab for all other documents loaded from a     file: URL. This is potentially dangerous if the local files came from different sources, such as in a     download directory. (CVE-2023-28161)\n\n  - While implementing on AudioWorklets, some code may have casted one type to another, invalid, dynamic type.\n    This could have lead to a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2023-28162)\n\n  - When accessing throttled streams, the count of available bytes needed to be checked in the calling     function to be within bounds. This may have lead future code to be incorrect and vulnerable.\n    (CVE-2023-25752)\n\n  - When downloading files through the Save As dialog on Windows with suggested filenames containing     environment variable names, Windows would have resolved those in the context of the current user.  This     bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other versions of Firefox are unaffected. (CVE-2023-28163)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Timothy Nikkel, Andrew McCreight, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety     bugs present in Firefox 110 and Firefox ESR 102.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption     and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.\n    (CVE-2023-28176)\n\n  - Mozilla developers and community members Calixte Denizet, Gabriele Svelto, Andrew McCreight, and the     Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 110. Some of these bugs showed     evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been     exploited to run arbitrary code.

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2022-47 advisory.\n\n  - Service Workers should not be able to infer information about opaque cross-origin responses; but timing     information for cross-origin media combined with Range requests might have allowed them to determine the     presence or length of a media file. (CVE-2022-45403)\n\n  - Through a series of popup and <code>window.print()</code> calls, an attacker can cause a window to go     fullscreen without the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in potential user confusion or     spoofing attacks. (CVE-2022-45404)\n\n  - Freeing arbitrary <code>nsIInputStream</code>'s on a different thread than creation could have led to a     use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-45405)\n\n  - If an out-of-memory condition occurred when creating a JavaScript global, a JavaScript realm may be     deleted while references to it lived on in a BaseShape. This could lead to a use-after-free causing a     potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-45406)\n\n  - If an attacker loaded a font using <code>FontFace()</code> on a background worker, a use-after-free could     have occurred, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-45407)\n\n  - Through a series of popups that reuse windowName, an attacker can cause a window to go fullscreen without     the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.\n    (CVE-2022-45408)\n\n  - The garbage collector could have been aborted in several states and zones and     <code>GCRuntime::finishCollection</code> may not have been called, leading to a use-after-free and     potentially exploitable crash (CVE-2022-45409)\n\n  - When a ServiceWorker intercepted a request with <code>FetchEvent</code>, the origin of the request was     lost after the ServiceWorker took ownership of it.  This had the effect of negating SameSite cookie     protections.  This was addressed in the spec and then in browsers. (CVE-2022-45410)\n\n  - Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method, allowing an XSS     attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies     protected by HTTPOnly).  To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and     XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-     Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again.  Firefox has applied     the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. (CVE-2022-45411)\n\n  - When resolving a symlink such as <code>file:///proc/self/fd/1</code>, an error message may be produced     where the symlink was resolved to a string containing unitialized memory in the buffer.  This bug only     affects Firefox on Unix-based operated systems (Android, Linux, MacOS). Windows is unaffected.\n    (CVE-2022-45412)\n\n  - Using the <code>S.browserfallbackurl parameter</code> parameter, an attacker could redirect a user to a     URL and cause SameSite=Strict cookies to be sent. This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other     operating systems are not affected. (CVE-2022-45413)\n\n  - A flaw in XML parsing could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. In     official releases of Firefox this vulnerability is mitigated by wasm sandboxing; versions managed by Linux     distributions may have other settings. (CVE-2022-40674)\n\n  - When downloading an HTML file, if the title of the page was formatted as a filename with a malicious     extension, Firefox may have saved the file with that extension, leading to possible system compromise if     the downloaded file was later ran. (CVE-2022-45415)\n\n  - Keyboard events reference strings like KeyA that were at fixed, known, and widely-spread addresses.\n    Cache-based timing attacks such as Prime+Probe could have possibly figured out which keys were being     pressed. (CVE-2022-45416)\n\n  - Service Workers did not detect Private Browsing Mode correctly in all cases, which could have led to     Service Workers being written to disk for websites visited in Private Browsing Mode.  This would not have     persisted them in a state where they would run again, but it would have leaked Private Browsing Mode     details to disk. (CVE-2022-45417)\n\n  - If a custom mouse cursor is specified in CSS, under certain circumstances the cursor could have been drawn     over the browser UI, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks. (CVE-2022-45418)\n\n  - If the user added a security exception for an invalid TLS certificate, opened an ongoing TLS connection     with a server that used that certificate, and then deleted the exception, Firefox would have kept the     connection alive, making it seem like the certificate was still trusted. (CVE-2022-45419)\n\n  - Using tables inside of an iframe, an attacker could have caused iframe contents to be rendered outside the     boundaries of the iframe, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks. (CVE-2022-45420)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight and Gabriele Svelto reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 106     and Firefox ESR 102.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with     enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

(CVE-2023-32207)\n\n  - Service workers could reveal script base URL due to dynamic <code>import()</code>. (CVE-2023-32208)\n\n  - A maliciously crafted favicon could have led to an out of memory crash.

This could have been used to fool the user into submitting     data intended for the spoofed origin. (CVE-2022-38472)\n\n  - A cross-origin iframe referencing an XSLT document would inherit the parent domain's permissions (such as     microphone or camera access). (CVE-2022-38473)\n\n  - A website that had permission to access the microphone could record audio without the audio notification     being shown. This bug does not allow the attacker to bypass the permission prompt - it only affects the     notification shown once permission has been granted.<br />This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other     operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-38474)\n\n  - An attacker could have written a value to the first element in a zero-length JavaScript array.

(CVE-2021-38503)\n\n  - When interacting with an HTML input element's file picker dialog with <code>webkitdirectory</code> set, a     use-after-free could have resulted, leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.\n    (CVE-2021-38504)\n\n  - Microsoft introduced a new feature in Windows 10 known as Cloud Clipboard which, if enabled, will record     data copied to the clipboard to the cloud, and make it available on other computers in certain scenarios.\n    Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being recorded in Cloud History must use specific     clipboard formats; and Firefox before versions 94 and ESR 91.3 did not implement them. This could have     caused sensitive data to be recorded to a user's Microsoft account. This bug only affects Firefox for     Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2021-38505)\n\n  - Through a series of navigations, Firefox could have entered fullscreen mode without notification or     warning to the user. This could lead to spoofing attacks on the browser UI including phishing.\n    (CVE-2021-38506)\n\n  - The Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 (RFC 8164) allows a connection to be transparently upgraded     to TLS while retaining the visual properties of an HTTP connection, including being same-origin with     unencrypted connections on port 80.  However, if a second encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port     8443) did not opt-in to opportunistic encryption; a network attacker could forward a connection from the     browser to port 443 to port 8443, causing the browser to treat the content of port 8443 as same-origin     with HTTP.  This was resolved by disabling the Opportunistic Encryption feature, which had low usage.\n    (CVE-2021-38507)\n\n  - By displaying a form validity message in the correct location at the same time as a permission prompt     (such as for geolocation), the validity message could have obscured the prompt, resulting in the user     potentially being tricked into granting the permission. (CVE-2021-38508)\n\n  - Due to an unusual sequence of attacker-controlled events, a Javascript <code>alert()</code> dialog with     arbitrary (although unstyled) contents could be displayed over top an uncontrolled webpage of the     attacker's choosing. (CVE-2021-38509)\n\n  - The executable file warning was not presented when downloading .inetloc files, which can run commands on a     user's computer.

(CVE-2022-42928)\n\n  - If a website called <code>window.print()</code> in a particular way, it could cause a denial of service of     the browser, which may persist beyond browser restart depending on the user's session restore settings.\n    (CVE-2022-42929)\n\n  - If two Workers were simultaneously initializing their CacheStorage, a data race could have occurred in the     <code>ThirdPartyUtil</code> component. (CVE-2022-42930)\n\n  - Logins saved by Firefox should be managed by the Password Manager component which uses encryption to save     files on-disk.

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2022-47 advisory.\n\n  - Service Workers should not be able to infer information about opaque cross-origin responses; but timing     information for cross-origin media combined with Range requests might have allowed them to determine the     presence or length of a media file. (CVE-2022-45403)\n\n  - Through a series of popup and <code>window.print()</code> calls, an attacker can cause a window to go     fullscreen without the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in potential user confusion or     spoofing attacks. (CVE-2022-45404)\n\n  - Freeing arbitrary <code>nsIInputStream</code>'s on a different thread than creation could have led to a     use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-45405)\n\n  - If an out-of-memory condition occurred when creating a JavaScript global, a JavaScript realm may be     deleted while references to it lived on in a BaseShape. This could lead to a use-after-free causing a     potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-45406)\n\n  - If an attacker loaded a font using <code>FontFace()</code> on a background worker, a use-after-free could     have occurred, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-45407)\n\n  - Through a series of popups that reuse windowName, an attacker can cause a window to go fullscreen without     the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.\n    (CVE-2022-45408)\n\n  - The garbage collector could have been aborted in several states and zones and     <code>GCRuntime::finishCollection</code> may not have been called, leading to a use-after-free and     potentially exploitable crash (CVE-2022-45409)\n\n  - When a ServiceWorker intercepted a request with <code>FetchEvent</code>, the origin of the request was     lost after the ServiceWorker took ownership of it.  This had the effect of negating SameSite cookie     protections.  This was addressed in the spec and then in browsers. (CVE-2022-45410)\n\n  - Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method, allowing an XSS     attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies     protected by HTTPOnly).  To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and     XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-     Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again.  Firefox has applied     the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. (CVE-2022-45411)\n\n  - When resolving a symlink such as <code>file:///proc/self/fd/1</code>, an error message may be produced     where the symlink was resolved to a string containing unitialized memory in the buffer.  This bug only     affects Firefox on Unix-based operated systems (Android, Linux, MacOS). Windows is unaffected.\n    (CVE-2022-45412)\n\n  - Using the <code>S.browserfallbackurl parameter</code> parameter, an attacker could redirect a user to a     URL and cause SameSite=Strict cookies to be sent. This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other     operating systems are not affected. (CVE-2022-45413)\n\n  - A flaw in XML parsing could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. In     official releases of Firefox this vulnerability is mitigated by wasm sandboxing; versions managed by Linux     distributions may have other settings. (CVE-2022-40674)\n\n  - When downloading an HTML file, if the title of the page was formatted as a filename with a malicious     extension, Firefox may have saved the file with that extension, leading to possible system compromise if     the downloaded file was later ran. (CVE-2022-45415)\n\n  - Keyboard events reference strings like KeyA that were at fixed, known, and widely-spread addresses.\n    Cache-based timing attacks such as Prime+Probe could have possibly figured out which keys were being     pressed. (CVE-2022-45416)\n\n  - Service Workers did not detect Private Browsing Mode correctly in all cases, which could have led to     Service Workers being written to disk for websites visited in Private Browsing Mode.  This would not have     persisted them in a state where they would run again, but it would have leaked Private Browsing Mode     details to disk. (CVE-2022-45417)\n\n  - If a custom mouse cursor is specified in CSS, under certain circumstances the cursor could have been drawn     over the browser UI, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks. (CVE-2022-45418)\n\n  - If the user added a security exception for an invalid TLS certificate, opened an ongoing TLS connection     with a server that used that certificate, and then deleted the exception, Firefox would have kept the     connection alive, making it seem like the certificate was still trusted. (CVE-2022-45419)\n\n  - Using tables inside of an iframe, an attacker could have caused iframe contents to be rendered outside the     boundaries of the iframe, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks. (CVE-2022-45420)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight and Gabriele Svelto reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 106     and Firefox ESR 102.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with     enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

remote Windows host is prior to 103.0. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2022-28 advisory.\n\n  - When combining CSS properties for overflow and transform, the mouse cursor could interact with different     coordinates than displayed. (CVE-2022-36319)\n\n  - When visiting a website with an overly long URL, the user interface would start to hang. Due to session     restore, this could lead to a permanent Denial of Service. This bug only affects Firefox for Android.\n    Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-36317)\n\n  - When visiting directory listings for `chrome://` URLs as source text, some parameters were reflected.\n    (CVE-2022-36318)\n\n  - When opening a Windows shortcut from the local filesystem, an attacker could supply a remote path that     would lead to unexpected network requests from the operating system. This bug only affects Firefox for     Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-36314)\n\n  - When loading a script with Subresource Integrity, attackers with an injection capability could trigger the     reuse of previously cached entries with incorrect, different integrity metadata. (CVE-2022-36315)\n\n  - When using the Performance API, an attacker was able to notice subtle differences between     PerformanceEntries and thus learn whether the target URL had been subject to a redirect. (CVE-2022-36316)\n\n  - Mozilla developers and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 102. Some     of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these     could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

remote Windows host is prior to 107.0. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2022-47 advisory.\n\n  - Service Workers should not be able to infer information about opaque cross-origin responses; but timing     information for cross-origin media combined with Range requests might have allowed them to determine the     presence or length of a media file. (CVE-2022-45403)\n\n  - Through a series of popup and <code>window.print()</code> calls, an attacker can cause a window to go     fullscreen without the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in potential user confusion or     spoofing attacks. (CVE-2022-45404)\n\n  - Freeing arbitrary <code>nsIInputStream</code>'s on a different thread than creation could have led to a     use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-45405)\n\n  - If an out-of-memory condition occurred when creating a JavaScript global, a JavaScript realm may be     deleted while references to it lived on in a BaseShape. This could lead to a use-after-free causing a     potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-45406)\n\n  - If an attacker loaded a font using <code>FontFace()</code> on a background worker, a use-after-free could     have occurred, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-45407)\n\n  - Through a series of popups that reuse windowName, an attacker can cause a window to go fullscreen without     the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.\n    (CVE-2022-45408)\n\n  - The garbage collector could have been aborted in several states and zones and     <code>GCRuntime::finishCollection</code> may not have been called, leading to a use-after-free and     potentially exploitable crash (CVE-2022-45409)\n\n  - When a ServiceWorker intercepted a request with <code>FetchEvent</code>, the origin of the request was     lost after the ServiceWorker took ownership of it.  This had the effect of negating SameSite cookie     protections.  This was addressed in the spec and then in browsers. (CVE-2022-45410)\n\n  - Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method, allowing an XSS     attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies     protected by HTTPOnly).  To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and     XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-     Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again.  Firefox has applied     the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. (CVE-2022-45411)\n\n  - When resolving a symlink such as <code>file:///proc/self/fd/1</code>, an error message may be produced     where the symlink was resolved to a string containing unitialized memory in the buffer.  This bug only     affects Firefox on Unix-based operated systems (Android, Linux, MacOS). Windows is unaffected.\n    (CVE-2022-45412)\n\n  - Using the <code>S.browserfallbackurl parameter</code> parameter, an attacker could redirect a user to a     URL and cause SameSite=Strict cookies to be sent. This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other     operating systems are not affected. (CVE-2022-45413)\n\n  - A flaw in XML parsing could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. In     official releases of Firefox this vulnerability is mitigated by wasm sandboxing; versions managed by Linux     distributions may have other settings. (CVE-2022-40674)\n\n  - When downloading an HTML file, if the title of the page was formatted as a filename with a malicious     extension, Firefox may have saved the file with that extension, leading to possible system compromise if     the downloaded file was later ran. (CVE-2022-45415)\n\n  - Keyboard events reference strings like KeyA that were at fixed, known, and widely-spread addresses.\n    Cache-based timing attacks such as Prime+Probe could have possibly figured out which keys were being     pressed. (CVE-2022-45416)\n\n  - Service Workers did not detect Private Browsing Mode correctly in all cases, which could have led to     Service Workers being written to disk for websites visited in Private Browsing Mode.  This would not have     persisted them in a state where they would run again, but it would have leaked Private Browsing Mode     details to disk.

(CVE-2022-45418)\n\n  - If the user added a security exception for an invalid TLS certificate, opened an ongoing TLS connection     with a server that used that certificate, and then deleted the exception, Firefox would have kept the     connection alive, making it seem like the certificate was still trusted. (CVE-2022-45419)\n\n  - Using tables inside of an iframe, an attacker could have caused iframe contents to be rendered outside the     boundaries of the iframe, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks. (CVE-2022-45420)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight and Gabriele Svelto reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 106     and Firefox ESR 102.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with     enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

(CVE-2021-38503)\n\n  - When interacting with an HTML input element's file picker dialog with <code>webkitdirectory</code> set, a     use-after-free could have resulted, leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.\n    (CVE-2021-38504)\n\n  - Microsoft introduced a new feature in Windows 10 known as Cloud Clipboard which, if enabled, will record     data copied to the clipboard to the cloud, and make it available on other computers in certain scenarios.\n    Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being recorded in Cloud History must use specific     clipboard formats; and Firefox before versions 94 and ESR 91.3 did not implement them. This could have     caused sensitive data to be recorded to a user's Microsoft account. This bug only affects Firefox for     Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2021-38505)\n\n  - Through a series of navigations, Firefox could have entered fullscreen mode without notification or     warning to the user. This could lead to spoofing attacks on the browser UI including phishing.\n    (CVE-2021-38506)\n\n  - The Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 (RFC 8164) allows a connection to be transparently upgraded     to TLS while retaining the visual properties of an HTTP connection, including being same-origin with     unencrypted connections on port 80.  However, if a second encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port     8443) did not opt-in to opportunistic encryption; a network attacker could forward a connection from the     browser to port 443 to port 8443, causing the browser to treat the content of port 8443 as same-origin     with HTTP.  This was resolved by disabling the Opportunistic Encryption feature, which had low usage.\n    (CVE-2021-38507)\n\n  - By displaying a form validity message in the correct location at the same time as a permission prompt     (such as for geolocation), the validity message could have obscured the prompt, resulting in the user     potentially being tricked into granting the permission. (CVE-2021-38508)\n\n  - Due to an unusual sequence of attacker-controlled events, a Javascript <code>alert()</code> dialog with     arbitrary (although unstyled) contents could be displayed over top an uncontrolled webpage of the     attacker's choosing. (CVE-2021-38509)\n\n  - The executable file warning was not presented when downloading .inetloc files, which can run commands on a     user's computer. Note: This issue only affected Mac OS operating systems. Other operating systems are     unaffected.

This bug only affects Firefox for Android.\n    Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2023-25748)\n\n  - Android applications with unpatched vulnerabilities can be launched from a browser using Intents, exposing     users to these vulnerabilities. Firefox will now confirm with users that they want to launch an external     application before doing so.  This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other versions of Firefox are     unaffected. (CVE-2023-25749)\n\n  - Under certain circumstances, a ServiceWorker's offline cache may have leaked to the file system when using     private browsing mode. (CVE-2023-25750)\n\n  - Sometimes, when invalidating JIT code while following an iterator, the newly generated code could be     overwritten incorrectly. This could lead to a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2023-25751)\n\n  - When following a redirect to a publicly accessible web extension file, the URL may have been translated to     the actual local path, leaking potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2023-28160)\n\n  - Dragging a URL from a cross-origin iframe that was removed during the drag could have lead to user     confusion and website spoofing attacks. (CVE-2023-28164)\n\n  - If temporary one-time permissions, such as the ability to use the Camera, were granted to a document     loaded using a file: URL, that permission persisted in that tab for all other documents loaded from a     file: URL. This is potentially dangerous if the local files came from different sources, such as in a     download directory. (CVE-2023-28161)\n\n  - While implementing on AudioWorklets, some code may have casted one type to another, invalid, dynamic type.\n    This could have lead to a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2023-28162)\n\n  - When accessing throttled streams, the count of available bytes needed to be checked in the calling     function to be within bounds. This may have lead future code to be incorrect and vulnerable.\n    (CVE-2023-25752)\n\n  - When downloading files through the Save As dialog on Windows with suggested filenames containing     environment variable names, Windows would have resolved those in the context of the current user.

remote Windows host is prior to 108.0. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2022-51 advisory.\n\n  - An out of date library (libusrsctp) contained vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited.\n    (CVE-2022-46871)\n\n  - An attacker who compromised a content process could have partially escaped the sandbox to read arbitrary     files via clipboard-related IPC messages. This bug only affects Firefox for Linux. Other operating systems     are unaffected. (CVE-2022-46872)\n\n  - Because Firefox did not implement the <code>unsafe-hashes</code> CSP directive, an attacker who was able     to inject markup into a page otherwise protected by a Content Security Policy may have been able to inject     executable script.  This would be severely constrained by the specified Content Security Policy of the     document. (CVE-2022-46873)\n\n  - A file with a long filename could have had its filename truncated to remove the valid extension, leaving a     malicious extension in its place. This could have potentially led to user confusion and the execution of     malicious code. (CVE-2022-46874)\n\n  - The executable file warning was not presented when downloading .atloc and .ftploc files, which can run     commands on a user's computer.  Note: This issue only affected Mac OS operating systems. Other operating     systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-46875)\n\n  - By confusing the browser, the fullscreen notification could have been delayed or suppressed, resulting in     potential user confusion or spoofing attacks. (CVE-2022-46877)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Valentin Gosu, Olli Pettay, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory     safety bugs present in Firefox 107 and Firefox ESR 102.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory     corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary     code. (CVE-2022-46878)\n\n  - Mozilla developers and community members Lukas Bernhard, Gabriele Svelto, Randell Jesup, and the Mozilla     Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 107. Some of these bugs showed evidence of     memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run     arbitrary code.

The supported version that is     affected is Java SE: 8u301. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access     via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized     ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Java SE as well as unauthorized update,     insert or delete access to some of Java SE accessible data and unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE     accessible data. This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web     Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the     internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments,     typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).     (CVE-2021-3517)\n\n  - Vulnerability in the Java SE product of Oracle Java SE (component: Deployment). The supported version that is     affected is Java SE: 8u301. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access     via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than     the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE. This vulnerability     applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java     applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for     security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted     code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). (CVE-2021-35560)\n\n  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Libraries).     Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 8u301, 11.0.12, 17; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.3 and     21.2.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via Kerberos to     compromise Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person     other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition, attacks may     significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access     to critical data or complete access to all Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data.

The supported version that is     affected is Java SE: 8u301. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access     via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized     ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Java SE as well as unauthorized update,     insert or delete access to some of Java SE accessible data and unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE     accessible data. This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web     Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the     internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments,     typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).     (CVE-2021-3517)\n\n  - Vulnerability in the Java SE product of Oracle Java SE (component: Deployment). The supported version that is     affected is Java SE: 8u301. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access     via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than     the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE. This vulnerability     applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java     applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for     security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted     code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). (CVE-2021-35560)\n\n  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Libraries).     Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 8u301, 11.0.12, 17; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.3 and     21.2.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via Kerberos to     compromise Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person     other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition, attacks may     significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access     to critical data or complete access to all Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data.

Given a reliable exploit primitive, this     new process could be exploited again leading to arbitrary file read. (CVE-2023-23597)\n\n  - Due to the Firefox GTK wrapper code's use of text/plain for drag data and GTK treating all text/plain     MIMEs containing file URLs as being dragged a website could arbitrarily read a file via a call to     <code>DataTransfer.setData</code>. (CVE-2023-23598)\n\n  - When copying a network request from the developer tools panel as a curl command the output was not being     properly sanitized and could allow arbitrary commands to be hidden within. (CVE-2023-23599)\n\n  - Per origin notification permissions were being stored in a way that didn't take into account what browsing     context the permission was granted in. This lead to the possibility of notifications to be displayed     during different browsing sessions. This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are     unaffected. (CVE-2023-23600)\n\n  - Navigations were being allowed when dragging a URL from a cross-origin iframe into the same tab which     could lead to website spoofing attacks (CVE-2023-23601)\n\n  - A mishandled security check when creating a WebSocket in a WebWorker caused the Content Security Policy     connect-src header to be ignored. This could lead to connections to restricted origins from inside     WebWorkers. (CVE-2023-23602)\n\n  - Regular expressions used to filter out forbidden properties and values from style directives in calls to     <code>console.log</code> weren't accounting for external URLs. Data could then be potentially exfiltrated     from the browser. (CVE-2023-23603)\n\n  - A duplicate <code>SystemPrincipal</code> object could be created when parsing a non-system html document     via <code>DOMParser::ParseFromSafeString</code>. This could have lead to bypassing web security checks.\n    (CVE-2023-23604)\n\n  - Mozilla developers and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 108 and     Firefox ESR 102.6.

An attacker who successfully exploited this     vulnerability could obtain information to further     compromise the users system.  (CVE-2020-16889)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when     Windows improperly handles COM object creation. An     attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability     could run arbitrary code with elevated privileges.\n    (CVE-2020-16916, CVE-2020-16935)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the     Windows Event System improperly handles objects in     memory.  (CVE-2020-16900)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when     Windows Hyper-V on a host server fails to properly     handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully     exploited these vulnerabilities could gain elevated     privileges on a target operating system. This     vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code to     be run. However, this vulnerability could be used in     conjunction with one or more vulnerabilities (e.g. a     remote code execution vulnerability and another     elevation of privilege) that could take advantage of the     elevated privileges when running. The update addresses     the vulnerabilities by correcting how Windows Hyper-V     handles objects in memory. (CVE-2020-1047,     CVE-2020-1080)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the     Windows Enterprise App Management Service improperly     handles certain file operations. An attacker who     successfully exploited this vulnerability could read     arbitrary files. An attacker with unprivileged access to     a vulnerable system could exploit this vulnerability.\n    The security update addresses the vulnerability by     ensuring the Windows Enterprise App Management Service     properly handles file operations.

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2022-40 advisory.\n\n  - During iframe navigation, certain pages did not have their FeaturePolicy fully initialized leading to a     bypass that leaked device permissions into untrusted subdocuments. (CVE-2022-40959)\n\n  - Concurrent use of the URL parser with non-UTF-8 data was not thread-safe. This could lead to a use-after-     free causing a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-40960)\n\n  - By injecting a cookie with certain special characters, an attacker on a shared subdomain which is not a     secure context could set and thus overwrite cookies from a secure context, leading to session fixation and     other attacks. (CVE-2022-40958)\n\n  - During startup, a graphics driver with an unexpected name could lead to a stack-buffer overflow causing a     potentially exploitable crash. This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are     not affected. (CVE-2022-40961)\n\n  - When injecting an HTML base element, some requests would ignore the CSP's base-uri settings and accept the     injected element's base instead. (CVE-2022-40956)\n\n  - Inconsistent data in instruction and data cache when creating wasm code could lead to a potentially     exploitable crash. This bug only affects Firefox on ARM64 platforms.

This bug only affects Firefox for Windows. Other operating     systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-22746)\n\n  - When navigating from inside an iframe while requesting fullscreen access, an attacker-controlled tab could     have made the browser unable to leave fullscreen mode. (CVE-2022-22743)\n\n  - When inserting text while in edit mode, some characters might have lead to out-of-bounds memory access     causing a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-22742)\n\n  - When resizing a popup while requesting fullscreen access, the popup would have become unable to leave     fullscreen mode. (CVE-2022-22741)\n\n  - Certain network request objects were freed too early when releasing a network request handle. This could     have lead to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-22740)\n\n  - Applying a CSS filter effect could have accessed out of bounds memory. This could have lead to a heap-     buffer-overflow causing a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-22738)\n\n  - Constructing audio sinks could have lead to a race condition when playing audio files and closing windows.\n    This could have lead to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-22737)\n\n  - It was possible to construct specific XSLT markup that would be able to bypass an iframe sandbox.\n    (CVE-2021-4140)\n\n  - By generally accepting and passing resource handles across processes, a compromised content process might     have confused higher privileged processes to interact with handles that the unprivileged process should     not have access to. This bug only affects Firefox for Windows and MacOS. Other operating systems are     unaffected. (CVE-2022-22750)\n\n  - When scanning QR codes, Firefox for Android would have allowed navigation to some URLs that do not point     to web content. This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.\n    (CVE-2022-22749)\n\n  - Malicious websites could have confused Firefox into showing the wrong origin when asking to launch a     program and handling an external URL protocol. (CVE-2022-22748)\n\n  - Securitypolicyviolation events could have leaked cross-origin information for frame-ancestors violations     (CVE-2022-22745)\n\n  - The constructed curl command from the Copy as curl feature in DevTools was not properly escaped for     PowerShell.  This could have lead to command injection if pasted into a Powershell prompt. This bug only     affects Firefox for Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-22744)\n\n  - After accepting an untrusted certificate, handling an empty pkcs7 sequence as part of the certificate data     could have lead to a crash. This crash is believed to be unexploitable. (CVE-2022-22747)\n\n  - If Firefox was installed to a world-writable directory, a local privilege escalation could occur when     Firefox searched the current directory for system libraries. However the install directory is not world-     writable by default. This bug only affects Firefox for Windows in a non-default installation. Other     operating systems are unaffected.

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities:\n\n  - An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the resource record-parsing functionality of Videolabs     libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing compressed labels in mDNS messages, the compression pointer is followed without checking     for recursion, leading to a denial of service. An attacker can send an mDNS message to trigger this vulnerability     (CVE-2020-6071).     \n\n  - An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the label-parsing functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0.     When parsing compressed labels in mDNS messages, the rr_decode function's return value is not checked, leading to a     double free that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code. An attacker can send an mDNS message to trigger this     vulnerability (CVE-2020-6072).\n\n  - An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the TXT record-parsing functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0.     When parsing the RDATA section in a TXT record in mDNS messages, multiple integer overflows can be triggered, leading to a denial     of service. An attacker can send an mDNS message to trigger this vulnerability (CVE-2020-6073).\n\n  - An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the message-parsing functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0.     When parsing mDNS messages, the implementation does not properly keep track of the available data in the message, possibly leading     to an out-of-bounds read that would result in a denial of service. An attacker can send an mDNS message to trigger this     vulnerability (CVE-2020-6077).\n\n  - An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the message-parsing functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0.     When parsing mDNS messages in mdns_recv, the return value of the mdns_read_header function is not checked, leading to an uninitialized     variable usage that eventually results in a null pointer dereference, leading to service crash. An attacker can send a series of     mDNS messages to trigger this vulnerability (CVE-2020-6078).\n\n  - An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the resource allocation handling of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0.     When encountering errors while parsing mDNS messages, some allocated data is not freed, possibly leading to a denial-of-service     condition via resource exhaustion. An attacker can send one mDNS message repeatedly to trigger this vulnerability through decoding     of the domain name performed by rr_decode (CVE-2020-6079).","exploit_available":false,"exploit_framework_canvas":false,"exploit_framework_core":false,"exploit_framework_d2_elliot":false,"exploit_framework_exploithub":false,"exploit_framework_metasploit":false,"exploitability_ease":"No known exploits are available","exploited_by_malware":false,"exploited_by_nessus":false,"family":"Windows","family_id":20,"has_patch":true,"id":136422,"in_the_news":false,"name":"VLC < 3.0.9 Multiple Vulnerabilities","patch_publication_date":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","modification_date":"2021-02-19T00:00:00Z","publication_date":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","risk_factor":"High","see_also":["https://www.videolan.org/security/sb-vlc309.html"],"solution":"Upgrade to VLC version 3.0.9 or later.","stig_severity":"II","synopsis":"The remote Windows host contains a media player that is affected by multiple vulnerabilities.","type":"local","unsupported_by_vendor":false,"version":"1.4","vuln_publication_date":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","xrefs":[{"type":"IAVB","id":"2020-B-0025-S"}],"vpr":{"score":6.7,"drivers":{"age_of_vuln":{"lower_bound":731},"exploit_code_maturity":"PROOF_OF_CONCEPT","cvss_impact_score_predicted":false,"cvss3_impact_score":5.9,"threat_intensity_last28":"VERY_LOW","threat_sources_last28":["No recorded events"],"product_coverage":"LOW"},"updated":"2023-03-02T06:00:26Z"}},"port":{"port":445,"protocol":"TCP"},"scan":{"completed_at":"2023-06-01T08:48:28.578Z","schedule_uuid":"0e919561-9d6a-9469-19d3-df6d3f7f2a83aa3f7e7e835ad6d3","started_at":"2023-06-01T08:05:52.432Z","uuid":"572bd6bd-f304-47b5-a4e2-7734c6dbbbe3"},"severity":"high","severity_id":3,"severity_default_id":3,"severity_modification_type":"NONE","first_found":"2020-11-13T12:47:02.093Z","last_found":"2023-06-01T08:48:28.578Z","state":"OPEN","indexed":"2023-06-01T08:49:43.769099Z"},{"asset":{"agent_uuid":"6368c07f38ef48feb5f43ed8b09e78a8","bios_uuid":"4C4C4544-004D-4A10-804B-C4C04F563532","device_type":"general-purpose","fqdn":"windigo2a.corp.shutterfly.com","hostname":"windigo2a","uuid":"08b1155d-4d52-4937-a11e-a210e8f2b720","ipv4":"172.22.114.177","last_authenticated_results":"2023-06-01T08:27:55Z","mac_address":"64:00:6A:4E:85:99","netbios_name":"WINDIGO2A","operating_system":["Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise Build 17763"],"network_id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","tracked":true},"output":"\nThe remote host is missing one of the following rollup KBs : \n  - 5023702\n\n  - C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\ntoskrnl.exe has not been patched.\n    Remote version : 10.0.17763.1879\n    Should be      : 10.0.17763.4131\n\n","plugin":{"checks_for_default_account":false,"checks_for_malware":false,"cpe":["cpe:/o:microsoft:windows"],"cve":["CVE-2023-24911","CVE-2023-24913","CVE-2023-23423","CVE-2023-23422","CVE-2023-24910","CVE-2023-24876","CVE-2023-1018","CVE-2023-1017","CVE-2023-23393","CVE-2023-24880","CVE-2023-23394","CVE-2023-21708","CVE-2023-23409","CVE-2023-23405","CVE-2023-24857","CVE-2023-23404","CVE-2023-24856","CVE-2023-23407","CVE-2023-24859","CVE-2023-23406","CVE-2023-24858","CVE-2023-23401","CVE-2023-23400","CVE-2023-23403","CVE-2023-23402","CVE-2023-23410","CVE-2023-24862","CVE-2023-24861","CVE-2023-24909","CVE-2023-24908","CVE-2023-24907","CVE-2023-24906","CVE-2023-23416","CVE-2023-24868","CVE-2023-23415","CVE-2023-24867","CVE-2023-23417","CVE-2023-24869","CVE-2023-23412","CVE-2023-24864","CVE-2023-23411","CVE-2023-24863","CVE-2023-23414","CVE-2023-24866","CVE-2023-23413","CVE-2023-24865","CVE-2023-23385","CVE-2023-24870","CVE-2023-23388","CVE-2023-23421","CVE-2023-23420","CVE-2023-24872"],"cvss3_base_score":9.8,"cvss3_temporal_score":9.4,"cvss3_temporal_vector":{"remediation_level":"Official-fix","report_confidence":"Confirmed","raw":"E:H/RL:O/RC:C"},"cvss3_vector":{"availability_impact":"High","confidentiality_impact":"High","integrity_impact":"High","raw":"AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},"cvss_base_score":10.0,"cvss_temporal_score":8.7,"cvss_temporal_vector":{"exploitability":"High","remediation_level":"Official-fix","report_confidence":"Confirmed","raw":"E:H/RL:OF/RC:C"},"cvss_vector":{"access_complexity":"Low","access_vector":"Network","authentication":"None required","availability_impact":"Complete","confidentiality_impact":"Complete","integrity_impact":"Complete","raw":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C"},"description":"The remote Windows host is missing security update 5023702.

This vulnerability     applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java     applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for     security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted     code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). (CVE-2021-35560)\n\n  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Libraries).     Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 8u301, 11.0.12, 17; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.3 and     21.2.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via Kerberos to     compromise Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person     other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition, attacks may     significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access     to critical data or complete access to all Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data.

to its self-reported version number, the installation of Apache Log4j on the remote host is 1.x and is no longer supported. Log4j reached its end of life prior to 2016. Additionally, Log4j 1.x is affected by multiple vulnerabilities, including :\n\n  - Log4j includes a SocketServer that accepts serialized log events and deserializes them without verifying whether     the objects are allowed or not. This can provide an attack vector that can be exploited. (CVE-2019-17571)\n\n  - Improper validation of certificate with host mismatch in Apache Log4j SMTP appender. This could allow an SMTPS     connection to be intercepted by a man-in-the-middle attack which could leak any log messages sent through that     appender. (CVE-2020-9488)\n\n  - JMSSink uses JNDI in an unprotected manner allowing any application using the JMSSink to be vulnerable if it is     configured to reference an untrusted site or if the site referenced can be accesseed by the attacker.\n    (CVE-2022-23302)\n\nLack of support implies that no new security patches for the product will be released by the vendor.

The supported version that is     affected is Java SE: 8u301. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access     via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized     ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Java SE as well as unauthorized update,     insert or delete access to some of Java SE accessible data and unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE     accessible data. This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web     Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the     internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments,     typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).     (CVE-2021-3517)\n\n  - Vulnerability in the Java SE product of Oracle Java SE (component: Deployment). The supported version that is     affected is Java SE: 8u301. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access     via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than     the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE. This vulnerability     applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java     applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for     security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted     code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). (CVE-2021-35560)\n\n  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Libraries).     Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 8u301, 11.0.12, 17; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.3 and     21.2.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via Kerberos to     compromise Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person     other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition, attacks may     significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access     to critical data or complete access to all Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data.

remote Windows host is prior to 97.0. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2022-04 advisory.\n\n  - A Time-of-Check Time-of-Use bug existed in the Maintenance (Updater) Service that could be abused to grant     Users write access to an arbitrary directory. This could have been used to escalate to SYSTEM access. This     bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-22753)\n\n  - If a user installed an extension of a particular type, the extension could have auto-updated itself and     while doing so, bypass the prompt which grants the new version the new requested permissions.\n    (CVE-2022-22754)\n\n  - By using XSL Transforms, a malicious webserver could have served a user an XSL document that would     continue to execute JavaScript (within the bounds of the same-origin policy) even after the tab was     closed. (CVE-2022-22755)\n\n  - If a user was convinced to drag and drop an image to their desktop or other folder, the resulting object     could have been changed into an executable script which would have run arbitrary code after the user     clicked on it. (CVE-2022-22756)\n\n  - Remote Agent, used in WebDriver, did not validate the Host or Origin headers. This could have allowed     websites to connect back locally to the user's browser to control it.  This bug only affected Firefox when     WebDriver was enabled, which is not the default configuration. (CVE-2022-22757)\n\n  - When clicking on a tel: link, USSD codes, specified after a <code></code> character, would be included in     the phone number.  On certain phones, or on certain carriers, if the number was dialed this could perform     actions on a user's account, similar to a cross-site request forgery attack. This bug only affects Firefox     for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-22758)\n\n  - If a document created a sandboxed iframe without <code>allow-scripts</code>, and subsequently appended an     element to the iframe's document that e.g. had a JavaScript event handler - the event handler would have     run despite the iframe's sandbox. (CVE-2022-22759)\n\n  - When importing resources using Web Workers, error messages would distinguish the difference between     <code>application/javascript</code> responses and non-script responses.  This could have been abused to     learn information cross-origin. (CVE-2022-22760)\n\n  - Web-accessible extension pages (pages with a moz-extension:// scheme) were not correctly enforcing the     frame-ancestors directive when it was used in the Web Extension's Content Security Policy.\n    (CVE-2022-22761)\n\n  - Under certain circumstances, a JavaScript alert (or prompt) could have been shown while another website     was displayed underneath it. This could have been abused to trick the user.  This bug only affects Firefox     for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-22762)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Paul Adenot and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox     96 and Firefox ESR 91.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with     enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

remote Windows host is prior to 97.0. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2022-04 advisory.\n\n  - A Time-of-Check Time-of-Use bug existed in the Maintenance (Updater) Service that could be abused to grant     Users write access to an arbitrary directory. This could have been used to escalate to SYSTEM access. This     bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-22753)\n\n  - If a user installed an extension of a particular type, the extension could have auto-updated itself and     while doing so, bypass the prompt which grants the new version the new requested permissions.\n    (CVE-2022-22754)\n\n  - By using XSL Transforms, a malicious webserver could have served a user an XSL document that would     continue to execute JavaScript (within the bounds of the same-origin policy) even after the tab was     closed. (CVE-2022-22755)\n\n  - If a user was convinced to drag and drop an image to their desktop or other folder, the resulting object     could have been changed into an executable script which would have run arbitrary code after the user     clicked on it. (CVE-2022-22756)\n\n  - Remote Agent, used in WebDriver, did not validate the Host or Origin headers. This could have allowed     websites to connect back locally to the user's browser to control it.  This bug only affected Firefox when     WebDriver was enabled, which is not the default configuration. (CVE-2022-22757)\n\n  - When clicking on a tel: link, USSD codes, specified after a <code></code> character, would be included in     the phone number.  On certain phones, or on certain carriers, if the number was dialed this could perform     actions on a user's account, similar to a cross-site request forgery attack. This bug only affects Firefox     for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-22758)\n\n  - If a document created a sandboxed iframe without <code>allow-scripts</code>, and subsequently appended an     element to the iframe's document that e.g. had a JavaScript event handler - the event handler would have     run despite the iframe's sandbox. (CVE-2022-22759)\n\n  - When importing resources using Web Workers, error messages would distinguish the difference between     <code>application/javascript</code> responses and non-script responses.  This could have been abused to     learn information cross-origin. (CVE-2022-22760)\n\n  - Web-accessible extension pages (pages with a moz-extension:// scheme) were not correctly enforcing the     frame-ancestors directive when it was used in the Web Extension's Content Security Policy.\n    (CVE-2022-22761)\n\n  - Under certain circumstances, a JavaScript alert (or prompt) could have been shown while another website     was displayed underneath it. This could have been abused to trick the user.  This bug only affects Firefox     for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-22762)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Paul Adenot and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox     96 and Firefox ESR 91.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with     enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-22764)\n\n  - Mozilla developers and community members Gabriele Svelto, Sebastian Hengst, Randell Jesup, Luan Herrera,     Lars T Hansen, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 96. Some of     these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could     have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

(CVE-2022-40959)\n\n  - Concurrent use of the URL parser with non-UTF-8 data was not thread-safe. This could lead to a use-after-     free causing a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-40960)\n\n  - By injecting a cookie with certain special characters, an attacker on a shared subdomain which is not a     secure context could set and thus overwrite cookies from a secure context, leading to session fixation and     other attacks. (CVE-2022-40958)\n\n  - During startup, a graphics driver with an unexpected name could lead to a stack-buffer overflow causing a     potentially exploitable crash. This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are     not affected. (CVE-2022-40961)\n\n  - When injecting an HTML base element, some requests would ignore the CSP's base-uri settings and accept the     injected element's base instead. (CVE-2022-40956)\n\n  - Inconsistent data in instruction and data cache when creating wasm code could lead to a potentially     exploitable crash. This bug only affects Firefox on ARM64 platforms.

This can provide an attack vector that can be exploited. (CVE-2019-17571)\n\n  - Improper validation of certificate with host mismatch in Apache Log4j SMTP appender. This could allow an SMTPS     connection to be intercepted by a man-in-the-middle attack which could leak any log messages sent through that     appender. (CVE-2020-9488)\n\n  - JMSSink uses JNDI in an unprotected manner allowing any application using the JMSSink to be vulnerable if it is     configured to reference an untrusted site or if the site referenced can be accesseed by the attacker.\n    (CVE-2022-23302)\n\nLack of support implies that no new security patches for the product will be released by the vendor.

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2023-05 advisory.\n\n  - The <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> header could allow an attacker to leak a child     iframe's unredacted URI when interaction with that iframe triggers a redirect. (CVE-2023-25728)\n\n  - A background script invoking <code>requestFullscreen</code> and then blocking the main thread could force     the browser into fullscreen mode indefinitely, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.\n    (CVE-2023-25730)\n\n  - A lack of in app notification for entering fullscreen mode could have lead to a malicious website spoofing     browser chrome. This bug only affects Firefox Focus. Other versions of Firefox are unaffected.\n    (CVE-2023-25743)\n\n  - An attacker could construct a PKCS 12 cert bundle in such a way that could allow for arbitrary memory     writes via PKCS 12 Safe Bag attributes being mishandled. (CVE-2023-0767)\n\n  - Cross-compartment wrappers wrapping a scripted proxy could have caused objects from other compartments to     be stored in the main compartment resulting in a use-after-free after unwrapping the proxy.\n    (CVE-2023-25735)\n\n  - An invalid downcast from <code>nsTextNode</code> to <code>SVGElement</code> could have lead to undefined     behavior. (CVE-2023-25737)\n\n  - Members of the <code>DEVMODEW</code> struct set by the printer device driver weren't being validated and     could have resulted in invalid values which in turn would cause the browser to attempt out of bounds     access to related variables. This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are     unaffected. (CVE-2023-25738)\n\n  - Module load requests that failed were not being checked as to whether or not they were cancelled causing a     use-after-free in <code>ScriptLoadContext</code>. (CVE-2023-25739)\n\n  - Permission prompts for opening external schemes were only shown for <code>ContentPrincipals</code>     resulting in extensions being able to open them without user interaction via     <code>ExpandedPrincipals</code>. This could lead to further malicious actions such as downloading files or     interacting with software already installed on the system. (CVE-2023-25729)\n\n  - When encoding data from an <code>inputStream</code> in <code>xpcom</code> the size of the input being     encoded was not correctly calculated potentially leading to an out of bounds memory write.\n    (CVE-2023-25732)\n\n  - After downloading a Windows <code>.url</code> shortcut from the local filesystem, an attacker could supply     a remote path that would lead to unexpected network requests from the operating system.  This also had the     potential to leak NTLM credentials to the resource. This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other     operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2023-25734)\n\n  - After downloading a Windows <code>.scf</code> script from the local filesystem, an attacker could supply a     remote path that would lead to unexpected network requests from the operating system. This also had the     potential to leak NTLM credentials to the resource. This bug only affects Firefox for Windows. Other     operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2023-25740)\n\n  - Due to URL previews in the network panel of developer tools improperly storing URLs, query parameters     could potentially be used to overwrite global objects in privileged code. (CVE-2023-25731)\n\n  - The return value from <code>gfx::SourceSurfaceSkia::Map()</code> wasn't being verified which could have     potentially lead to a null pointer dereference. (CVE-2023-25733)\n\n  - An invalid downcast from <code>nsHTMLDocument</code> to <code>nsIContent</code> could have lead to     undefined behavior. (CVE-2023-25736)\n\n  - When dragging and dropping an image cross-origin, the image's size could potentially be leaked. This     behavior was shipped in 109 and caused web compatibility problems as well as this security concern, so the     behavior was disabled until further review. (CVE-2023-25741)\n\n  - When importing a SPKI RSA public key as ECDSA P-256, the key would be handled incorrectly causing the tab     to crash. (CVE-2023-25742)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Kershaw Chang and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in     Firefox 109 and Firefox ESR 102.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume     that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-25744)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Timothy Nikkel, Gabriele Svelto, Jeff Muizelaar and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported     memory safety bugs present in Firefox 109. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we     presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.\n    (CVE-2023-25745)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.","exploit_available":false,"exploit_framework_canvas":false,"exploit_framework_core":false,"exploit_framework_d2_elliot":false,"exploit_framework_exploithub":false,"exploit_framework_metasploit":false,"exploitability_ease":"No known exploits are available","exploited_by_malware":false,"exploited_by_nessus":false,"family":"Windows","family_id":20,"has_patch":true,"id":171454,"in_the_news":false,"name":"Mozilla Firefox < 110.0","patch_publication_date":"2023-02-14T00:00:00Z","modification_date":"2023-03-16T00:00:00Z","publication_date":"2023-02-14T00:00:00Z","risk_factor":"High","see_also":["https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2023-05/"],"solution":"Upgrade to Mozilla Firefox version 110.0 or later.","stig_severity":"I","synopsis":"A web browser installed on the remote Windows host is affected by multiple vulnerabilities.","type":"local","unsupported_by_vendor":false,"version":"1.2","vuln_publication_date":"2023-02-14T00:00:00Z","xrefs":[{"type":"IAVA","id":"2023-A-0081-S"}],"vpr":{"score":8.4,"drivers":{"age_of_vuln":{"lower_bound":0,"upper_bound":0},"exploit_code_maturity":"UNPROVEN","cvss_impact_score_predicted":false,"cvss3_impact_score":5.9,"threat_intensity_last28":"VERY_LOW","threat_sources_last28":["No recorded events"],"product_coverage":"UNKNOWN"},"updated":"2023-02-21T06:00:48Z"}},"port":{"port":445,"protocol":"TCP"},"scan":{"completed_at":"2023-06-01T08:51:43.769Z","schedule_uuid":"0e919561-9d6a-9469-19d3-df6d3f7f2a83aa3f7e7e835ad6d3","started_at":"2023-06-01T08:05:52.432Z","uuid":"572bd6bd-f304-47b5-a4e2-7734c6dbbbe3"},"severity":"high","severity_id":3,"severity_default_id":3,"severity_modification_type":"NONE","first_found":"2023-04-27T00:37:43.375Z","last_found":"2023-06-01T08:51:43.769Z","state":"OPEN","indexed":"2023-06-01T08:53:00.313444Z"},{"asset":{"agent_uuid":"3ea2949f9d814a99a16ac704a309a2ea","bios_uuid":"4C4C4544-004A-3510-8033-B7C04F474232","device_type":"general-purpose","fqdn":"glab-002.corp.shutterfly.com","hostname":"glab-002","uuid":"adda5835-a942-4109-bb27-3b96aa1e3765","ipv4":"172.22.49.124","last_authenticated_results":"2023-06-01T08:36:25Z","mac_address":"64:00:6A:91:97:D9","netbios_name":"GLAB-002","operating_system":["Microsoft Windows 10 Pro Build 19042"],"network_id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","tracked":true},"output":"\nMicrosoft .NET Framework 4.8\nThe remote host is missing one of the following rollup KBs : \n\nCumulative\n  - 5022502\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\mscorlib.dll has not been patched.\n    Remote version : 4.8.4341.0\n    Should be      : 4.8.4614.0\n\nMicrosoft .NET Framework 3.5\nThe remote host is missing one of the following rollup KBs : \n\nCumulative\n  - 5022502\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\mscorlib.dll has not been patched.\n    Remote version : 2.0.50727.9151\n    Should be      : 2.0.50727.9168\n\n\n","plugin":{"checks_for_default_account":false,"checks_for_malware":false,"cpe":["cpe:/a:microsoft:.net_framework"],"cve":["CVE-2023-21808","CVE-2023-21722"],"cvss3_base_score":7.8,"cvss3_temporal_score":6.8,"cvss3_temporal_vector":{"remediation_level":"Official-fix","report_confidence":"Confirmed","raw":"E:U/RL:O/RC:C"},"cvss3_vector":{"availability_impact":"High","confidentiality_impact":"High","integrity_impact":"High","raw":"AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},"cvss_base_score":7.2,"cvss_temporal_score":5.3,"cvss_temporal_vector":{"exploitability":"Unproven","remediation_level":"Official-fix","report_confidence":"Confirmed","raw":"E:U/RL:OF/RC:C"},"cvss_vector":{"access_complexity":"Low","access_vector":"Local-access","authentication":"None required","availability_impact":"Complete","confidentiality_impact":"Complete","integrity_impact":"Complete","raw":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C"},"description":"The Microsoft .NET Framework installation on the remote host is missing a security update.

This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments,     typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).     (CVE-2021-3517)\n\n  - Vulnerability in the Java SE product of Oracle Java SE (component: Deployment). The supported version that is     affected is Java SE: 8u301. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access     via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than     the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE. This vulnerability     applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java     applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for     security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted     code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). (CVE-2021-35560)\n\n  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Libraries).     Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 8u301, 11.0.12, 17; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.3 and     21.2.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via Kerberos to     compromise Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person     other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition, attacks may     significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access     to critical data or complete access to all Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data.

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in     Microsoft Office software when it fails to properly     handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully     exploited the vulnerability could use a specially     crafted file to perform actions in the security context     of the current user. For example, the file could then     take actions on behalf of the logged-on user with the     same permissions as the current user. Exploitation of     this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially     crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft     Office software. In an email attack scenario, an     attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the     specially crafted file to the user and convincing the     user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario,     an attacker could host a website (or leverage a     compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided     content) that contains a specially crafted file that is     designed to exploit the vulnerability. However, an     attacker would have no way to force the user to visit     the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince     the user to click a link, typically by way of an     enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and     then convince the user to open the specially crafted     file.

An attacker could then install programs; view,     change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full     user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have     fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted     than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n    Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user     open a specially crafted file with an affected version     of Microsoft Office software.

This bug only affects Firefox for Linux. Other operating systems     are unaffected. (CVE-2022-46872)\n\n  - Because Firefox did not implement the <code>unsafe-hashes</code> CSP directive, an attacker who was able     to inject markup into a page otherwise protected by a Content Security Policy may have been able to inject     executable script.  This would be severely constrained by the specified Content Security Policy of the     document. (CVE-2022-46873)\n\n  - A file with a long filename could have had its filename truncated to remove the valid extension, leaving a     malicious extension in its place. This could have potentially led to user confusion and the execution of     malicious code. (CVE-2022-46874)\n\n  - The executable file warning was not presented when downloading .atloc and .ftploc files, which can run     commands on a user's computer.  Note: This issue only affected Mac OS operating systems. Other operating     systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-46875)\n\n  - By confusing the browser, the fullscreen notification could have been delayed or suppressed, resulting in     potential user confusion or spoofing attacks. (CVE-2022-46877)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Valentin Gosu, Olli Pettay, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory     safety bugs present in Firefox 107 and Firefox ESR 102.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory     corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary     code. (CVE-2022-46878)\n\n  - Mozilla developers and community members Lukas Bernhard, Gabriele Svelto, Randell Jesup, and the Mozilla     Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 107. Some of these bugs showed evidence of     memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run     arbitrary code.

(CVE-2022-34481)\n\n  - Even when an iframe was sandboxed with <code>allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation</code>, if it     received a redirect header to an external protocol the browser would process the redirect and prompt the     user as appropriate. (CVE-2022-34474)\n\n  - When a TLS Certificate error occurs on a domain protected by the HSTS header, the browser should not allow     the user to bypass the certificate error.  On Firefox for Android, the user was presented with the option     to bypass the error; this could only have been done by the user explicitly.  This bug only affects Firefox     for Android.

If the manifest had been tampered with on the server, an attacker     could trick the browser into downgrading the addon to a prior version. (CVE-2022-34471)\n\n  - If there was a PAC URL set and the server that hosts the PAC was not reachable, OCSP requests would have     been blocked, resulting in incorrect error pages being shown.

These applications have had     known vulnerabilities, exploited in the wild (although we know of none exploited through Firefox), so in     this release Firefox has blocked these protocols from prompting the user to open them.

(CVE-2022-34480)\n\n  - The MediaError message property should be consistent to avoid leaking information about cross-origin     resources; however for a same-site cross-origin resource, the message could have leaked information     enabling XS-Leaks attacks. (CVE-2022-34477)\n\n  - SVG <code><use></code> tags that referenced a same-origin document could have resulted in script     execution if attacker input was sanitized via the HTML Sanitizer API. This would have required the     attacker to reference a same-origin JavaScript file containing the script to be executed. (CVE-2022-34475)\n\n  - The HTML Sanitizer should have sanitized the <code>href</code> attribute of SVG <code><use></code>     tags; however it incorrectly did not sanitize <code>xlink:href</code> attributes.

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2022-24 advisory.\n\n  - A malicious website that could create a popup could have resized the popup to overlay the address bar with     its own content, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.   This bug only affects     Firefox for Linux. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-34479)\n\n  - Navigations between XML documents may have led to a use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash.\n    (CVE-2022-34470)\n\n  - An iframe that was not permitted to run scripts could do so if the user clicked on a     <code>javascript:</code> link. (CVE-2022-34468)\n\n  - An attacker who could have convinced a user to drag and drop an image to a filesystem could have     manipulated the resulting filename to contain an executable extension, and by extension potentially     tricked the user into executing malicious code.  While very similar, this is a separate issue from     CVE-2022-34483. (CVE-2022-34482)\n\n  - An attacker who could have convinced a user to drag and drop an image to a filesystem could have     manipulated the resulting filename to contain an executable extension, and by extension potentially     tricked the user into executing malicious code.  While very similar, this is a separate issue from     CVE-2022-34482. (CVE-2022-34483)\n\n  - ASN.1 parsing of an indefinite SEQUENCE inside an indefinite GROUP could have resulted in the parser     accepting malformed ASN.1. (CVE-2022-34476)\n\n  - In the <code>nsTArrayImpl::ReplaceElementsAt()</code> function, an integer overflow could have occurred     when the number of elements to replace was too large for the container. (CVE-2022-34481)\n\n  - Even when an iframe was sandboxed with <code>allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation</code>, if it     received a redirect header to an external protocol the browser would process the redirect and prompt the     user as appropriate. (CVE-2022-34474)\n\n  - When a TLS Certificate error occurs on a domain protected by the HSTS header, the browser should not allow     the user to bypass the certificate error.  On Firefox for Android, the user was presented with the option     to bypass the error; this could only have been done by the user explicitly.  This bug only affects Firefox     for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-34469)\n\n  - When downloading an update for an addon, the downloaded addon update's version was not verified to match     the version selected from the manifest.  If the manifest had been tampered with on the server, an attacker     could trick the browser into downgrading the addon to a prior version. (CVE-2022-34471)\n\n  - If there was a PAC URL set and the server that hosts the PAC was not reachable, OCSP requests would have     been blocked, resulting in incorrect error pages being shown. (CVE-2022-34472)\n\n  - The <code>ms-msdt</code>, <code>search</code>, and <code>search-ms</code> protocols deliver content to     Microsoft applications, bypassing the browser, when a user accepts a prompt. These applications have had     known vulnerabilities, exploited in the wild (although we know of none exploited through Firefox), so in     this release Firefox has blocked these protocols from prompting the user to open them. This bug only     affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-34478)\n\n  - If an object prototype was corrupted by an attacker, they would have been able to set undesired attributes     on a JavaScript object, leading to privileged code execution. (CVE-2022-2200)\n\n  - Within the <code>lginit()</code> function, if several allocations succeed but then one fails, an     uninitialized pointer would have been freed despite never being allocated. (CVE-2022-34480)\n\n  - The MediaError message property should be consistent to avoid leaking information about cross-origin     resources; however for a same-site cross-origin resource, the message could have leaked information     enabling XS-Leaks attacks. (CVE-2022-34477)\n\n  - SVG <code><use></code> tags that referenced a same-origin document could have resulted in script     execution if attacker input was sanitized via the HTML Sanitizer API. This would have required the     attacker to reference a same-origin JavaScript file containing the script to be executed. (CVE-2022-34475)\n\n  - The HTML Sanitizer should have sanitized the <code>href</code> attribute of SVG <code><use></code>     tags; however it incorrectly did not sanitize <code>xlink:href</code> attributes. (CVE-2022-34473)\n\n  - The Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported potential vulnerabilities present in Firefox 101 and Firefox ESR 91.10.\n    Some of these bugs showed evidence of JavaScript prototype or memory corruption and we presume that with     enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-34484)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Bryce Seager van Dyk and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported potential vulnerabilities     present in Firefox 101.

This bug only affects     Firefox for Linux. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-34479)\n\n  - Navigations between XML documents may have led to a use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash.\n    (CVE-2022-34470)\n\n  - An iframe that was not permitted to run scripts could do so if the user clicked on a     <code>javascript:</code> link. (CVE-2022-34468)\n\n  - An attacker who could have convinced a user to drag and drop an image to a filesystem could have     manipulated the resulting filename to contain an executable extension, and by extension potentially     tricked the user into executing malicious code.  While very similar, this is a separate issue from     CVE-2022-34483. (CVE-2022-34482)\n\n  - An attacker who could have convinced a user to drag and drop an image to a filesystem could have     manipulated the resulting filename to contain an executable extension, and by extension potentially     tricked the user into executing malicious code.  While very similar, this is a separate issue from     CVE-2022-34482. (CVE-2022-34483)\n\n  - ASN.1 parsing of an indefinite SEQUENCE inside an indefinite GROUP could have resulted in the parser     accepting malformed ASN.1. (CVE-2022-34476)\n\n  - In the <code>nsTArrayImpl::ReplaceElementsAt()</code> function, an integer overflow could have occurred     when the number of elements to replace was too large for the container. (CVE-2022-34481)\n\n  - Even when an iframe was sandboxed with <code>allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation</code>, if it     received a redirect header to an external protocol the browser would process the redirect and prompt the     user as appropriate. (CVE-2022-34474)\n\n  - When a TLS Certificate error occurs on a domain protected by the HSTS header, the browser should not allow     the user to bypass the certificate error.  On Firefox for Android, the user was presented with the option     to bypass the error; this could only have been done by the user explicitly.  This bug only affects Firefox     for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-34469)\n\n  - When downloading an update for an addon, the downloaded addon update's version was not verified to match     the version selected from the manifest.  If the manifest had been tampered with on the server, an attacker     could trick the browser into downgrading the addon to a prior version. (CVE-2022-34471)\n\n  - If there was a PAC URL set and the server that hosts the PAC was not reachable, OCSP requests would have     been blocked, resulting in incorrect error pages being shown. (CVE-2022-34472)\n\n  - The <code>ms-msdt</code>, <code>search</code>, and <code>search-ms</code> protocols deliver content to     Microsoft applications, bypassing the browser, when a user accepts a prompt. These applications have had     known vulnerabilities, exploited in the wild (although we know of none exploited through Firefox), so in     this release Firefox has blocked these protocols from prompting the user to open them. This bug only     affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-34478)\n\n  - If an object prototype was corrupted by an attacker, they would have been able to set undesired attributes     on a JavaScript object, leading to privileged code execution. (CVE-2022-2200)\n\n  - Within the <code>lginit()</code> function, if several allocations succeed but then one fails, an     uninitialized pointer would have been freed despite never being allocated. (CVE-2022-34480)\n\n  - The MediaError message property should be consistent to avoid leaking information about cross-origin     resources; however for a same-site cross-origin resource, the message could have leaked information     enabling XS-Leaks attacks. (CVE-2022-34477)\n\n  - SVG <code><use></code> tags that referenced a same-origin document could have resulted in script     execution if attacker input was sanitized via the HTML Sanitizer API. This would have required the     attacker to reference a same-origin JavaScript file containing the script to be executed. (CVE-2022-34475)\n\n  - The HTML Sanitizer should have sanitized the <code>href</code> attribute of SVG <code><use></code>     tags; however it incorrectly did not sanitize <code>xlink:href</code> attributes. (CVE-2022-34473)\n\n  - The Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported potential vulnerabilities present in Firefox 101 and Firefox ESR 91.10.\n    Some of these bugs showed evidence of JavaScript prototype or memory corruption and we presume that with     enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-34484)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Bryce Seager van Dyk and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported potential vulnerabilities     present in Firefox 101.

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2022-04 advisory.\n\n  - A Time-of-Check Time-of-Use bug existed in the Maintenance (Updater) Service that could be abused to grant     Users write access to an arbitrary directory. This could have been used to escalate to SYSTEM access. This     bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-22753)\n\n  - If a user installed an extension of a particular type, the extension could have auto-updated itself and     while doing so, bypass the prompt which grants the new version the new requested permissions.\n    (CVE-2022-22754)\n\n  - By using XSL Transforms, a malicious webserver could have served a user an XSL document that would     continue to execute JavaScript (within the bounds of the same-origin policy) even after the tab was     closed. (CVE-2022-22755)\n\n  - If a user was convinced to drag and drop an image to their desktop or other folder, the resulting object     could have been changed into an executable script which would have run arbitrary code after the user     clicked on it. (CVE-2022-22756)\n\n  - Remote Agent, used in WebDriver, did not validate the Host or Origin headers. This could have allowed     websites to connect back locally to the user's browser to control it.  This bug only affected Firefox when     WebDriver was enabled, which is not the default configuration. (CVE-2022-22757)\n\n  - When clicking on a tel: link, USSD codes, specified after a <code></code> character, would be included in     the phone number.  On certain phones, or on certain carriers, if the number was dialed this could perform     actions on a user's account, similar to a cross-site request forgery attack. This bug only affects Firefox     for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-22758)\n\n  - If a document created a sandboxed iframe without <code>allow-scripts</code>, and subsequently appended an     element to the iframe's document that e.g. had a JavaScript event handler - the event handler would have     run despite the iframe's sandbox. (CVE-2022-22759)\n\n  - When importing resources using Web Workers, error messages would distinguish the difference between     <code>application/javascript</code> responses and non-script responses.  This could have been abused to     learn information cross-origin. (CVE-2022-22760)\n\n  - Web-accessible extension pages (pages with a moz-extension:// scheme) were not correctly enforcing the     frame-ancestors directive when it was used in the Web Extension's Content Security Policy.\n    (CVE-2022-22761)\n\n  - Under certain circumstances, a JavaScript alert (or prompt) could have been shown while another website     was displayed underneath it. This could have been abused to trick the user.  This bug only affects Firefox     for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-22762)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Paul Adenot and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox     96 and Firefox ESR 91.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with     enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-22764)\n\n  - Mozilla developers and community members Gabriele Svelto, Sebastian Hengst, Randell Jesup, Luan Herrera,     Lars T Hansen, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 96. Some of     these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could     have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2023-05 advisory.\n\n  - The <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> header could allow an attacker to leak a child     iframe's unredacted URI when interaction with that iframe triggers a redirect. (CVE-2023-25728)\n\n  - A background script invoking <code>requestFullscreen</code> and then blocking the main thread could force     the browser into fullscreen mode indefinitely, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.\n    (CVE-2023-25730)\n\n  - A lack of in app notification for entering fullscreen mode could have lead to a malicious website spoofing     browser chrome. This bug only affects Firefox Focus. Other versions of Firefox are unaffected.\n    (CVE-2023-25743)\n\n  - An attacker could construct a PKCS 12 cert bundle in such a way that could allow for arbitrary memory     writes via PKCS 12 Safe Bag attributes being mishandled. (CVE-2023-0767)\n\n  - Cross-compartment wrappers wrapping a scripted proxy could have caused objects from other compartments to     be stored in the main compartment resulting in a use-after-free after unwrapping the proxy.\n    (CVE-2023-25735)\n\n  - An invalid downcast from <code>nsTextNode</code> to <code>SVGElement</code> could have lead to undefined     behavior. (CVE-2023-25737)\n\n  - Members of the <code>DEVMODEW</code> struct set by the printer device driver weren't being validated and     could have resulted in invalid values which in turn would cause the browser to attempt out of bounds     access to related variables. This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are     unaffected. (CVE-2023-25738)\n\n  - Module load requests that failed were not being checked as to whether or not they were cancelled causing a     use-after-free in <code>ScriptLoadContext</code>. (CVE-2023-25739)\n\n  - Permission prompts for opening external schemes were only shown for <code>ContentPrincipals</code>     resulting in extensions being able to open them without user interaction via     <code>ExpandedPrincipals</code>. This could lead to further malicious actions such as downloading files or     interacting with software already installed on the system. (CVE-2023-25729)\n\n  - When encoding data from an <code>inputStream</code> in <code>xpcom</code> the size of the input being     encoded was not correctly calculated potentially leading to an out of bounds memory write.\n    (CVE-2023-25732)\n\n  - After downloading a Windows <code>.url</code> shortcut from the local filesystem, an attacker could supply     a remote path that would lead to unexpected network requests from the operating system.  This also had the     potential to leak NTLM credentials to the resource. This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other     operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2023-25734)\n\n  - After downloading a Windows <code>.scf</code> script from the local filesystem, an attacker could supply a     remote path that would lead to unexpected network requests from the operating system. This also had the     potential to leak NTLM credentials to the resource. This bug only affects Firefox for Windows. Other     operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2023-25740)\n\n  - Due to URL previews in the network panel of developer tools improperly storing URLs, query parameters     could potentially be used to overwrite global objects in privileged code. (CVE-2023-25731)\n\n  - The return value from <code>gfx::SourceSurfaceSkia::Map()</code> wasn't being verified which could have     potentially lead to a null pointer dereference. (CVE-2023-25733)\n\n  - An invalid downcast from <code>nsHTMLDocument</code> to <code>nsIContent</code> could have lead to     undefined behavior. (CVE-2023-25736)\n\n  - When dragging and dropping an image cross-origin, the image's size could potentially be leaked. This     behavior was shipped in 109 and caused web compatibility problems as well as this security concern, so the     behavior was disabled until further review. (CVE-2023-25741)\n\n  - When importing a SPKI RSA public key as ECDSA P-256, the key would be handled incorrectly causing the tab     to crash. (CVE-2023-25742)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Kershaw Chang and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in     Firefox 109 and Firefox ESR 102.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume     that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-25744)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Timothy Nikkel, Gabriele Svelto, Jeff Muizelaar and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported     memory safety bugs present in Firefox 109. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we     presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.\n    (CVE-2023-25745)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.","exploit_available":false,"exploit_framework_canvas":false,"exploit_framework_core":false,"exploit_framework_d2_elliot":false,"exploit_framework_exploithub":false,"exploit_framework_metasploit":false,"exploitability_ease":"No known exploits are available","exploited_by_malware":false,"exploited_by_nessus":false,"family":"Windows","family_id":20,"has_patch":true,"id":171454,"in_the_news":false,"name":"Mozilla Firefox < 110.0","patch_publication_date":"2023-02-14T00:00:00Z","modification_date":"2023-03-16T00:00:00Z","publication_date":"2023-02-14T00:00:00Z","risk_factor":"High","see_also":["https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2023-05/"],"solution":"Upgrade to Mozilla Firefox version 110.0 or later.","stig_severity":"I","synopsis":"A web browser installed on the remote Windows host is affected by multiple vulnerabilities.","type":"local","unsupported_by_vendor":false,"version":"1.2","vuln_publication_date":"2023-02-14T00:00:00Z","xrefs":[{"type":"IAVA","id":"2023-A-0081-S"}],"vpr":{"score":8.4,"drivers":{"age_of_vuln":{"lower_bound":0,"upper_bound":0},"exploit_code_maturity":"UNPROVEN","cvss_impact_score_predicted":false,"cvss3_impact_score":5.9,"threat_intensity_last28":"VERY_LOW","threat_sources_last28":["No recorded events"],"product_coverage":"UNKNOWN"},"updated":"2023-02-21T06:00:48Z"}},"port":{"port":445,"protocol":"TCP"},"scan":{"completed_at":"2023-06-01T09:21:21.559Z","schedule_uuid":"0e919561-9d6a-9469-19d3-df6d3f7f2a83aa3f7e7e835ad6d3","started_at":"2023-06-01T08:05:52.432Z","uuid":"572bd6bd-f304-47b5-a4e2-7734c6dbbbe3"},"severity":"high","severity_id":3,"severity_default_id":3,"severity_modification_type":"NONE","first_found":"2023-04-12T08:18:08.542Z","last_found":"2023-06-01T09:21:21.559Z","state":"OPEN","indexed":"2023-06-01T09:22:40.213923Z"},{"asset":{"agent_uuid":"3ea2949f9d814a99a16ac704a309a2ea","bios_uuid":"4C4C4544-004A-3510-8033-B7C04F474232","device_type":"general-purpose","fqdn":"glab-002.corp.shutterfly.com","hostname":"glab-002","uuid":"adda5835-a942-4109-bb27-3b96aa1e3765","ipv4":"172.22.49.124","last_authenticated_results":"2023-06-01T08:36:25Z","mac_address":"64:00:6A:91:97:D9","netbios_name":"GLAB-002","operating_system":["Microsoft Windows 10 Pro Build 19042"],"network_id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","tracked":true},"output":"\n  Path              : C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Adobe Photoshop 2021\\\n  Installed version : 22.2.0\n  Fixed version     : 22.5.7\n","plugin":{"checks_for_default_account":false,"checks_for_malware":false,"cpe":["cpe:/a:adobe:photoshop"],"cve":["CVE-2022-23205","CVE-2022-24105","CVE-2022-28278","CVE-2022-28277","CVE-2022-28279","CVE-2022-28270","CVE-2022-28272","CVE-2022-28271","CVE-2022-28274","CVE-2022-28273","CVE-2022-24098","CVE-2022-28276","CVE-2022-28275"],"cvss3_base_score":7.8,"cvss3_temporal_score":6.8,"cvss3_temporal_vector":{"remediation_level":"Official-fix","report_confidence":"Confirmed","raw":"E:U/RL:O/RC:C"},"cvss3_vector":{"availability_impact":"High","confidentiality_impact":"High","integrity_impact":"High","raw":"AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},"cvss_base_score":9.3,"cvss_temporal_score":6.9,"cvss_temporal_vector":{"exploitability":"Unproven","remediation_level":"Official-fix","report_confidence":"Confirmed","raw":"E:U/RL:OF/RC:C"},"cvss_vector":{"access_complexity":"Medium","access_vector":"Network","authentication":"None required","availability_impact":"Complete","confidentiality_impact":"Complete","integrity_impact":"Complete","raw":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C"},"description":"The version of Adobe Photoshop installed on the remote Windows host is prior to 22.5.7/23.3.

An attacker     who successfully exploited this vulnerability could     trick a user into believing that the user was on a     legitimate website. The specially crafted website could     either spoof content or serve as a pivot to chain an     attack with other vulnerabilities in web services.\n    (CVE-2018-8564)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in     Windows when the Win32k component fails to properly     handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully     exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in     kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs;\n    view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts     with full user rights.  (CVE-2018-8562)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when     &quot;Kernel Remote Procedure Call Provider&quot; driver     improperly initializes objects in memory.\n    (CVE-2018-8407)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the     win32k component improperly provides kernel information.\n    An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability     could obtain information to further compromise the users     system.  (CVE-2018-8565)\n\n  - A security feature bypass exists when Windows     incorrectly validates kernel driver signatures. An     attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability     could bypass security features and load improperly     signed drivers into the kernel. In an attack scenario,     an attacker could bypass security features intended to     prevent improperly signed drivers from being loaded by     the kernel. The update addresses the vulnerability by     correcting how Windows validates kernel driver     signatures.

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2022-47 advisory.\n\n  - Service Workers should not be able to infer information about opaque cross-origin responses; but timing     information for cross-origin media combined with Range requests might have allowed them to determine the     presence or length of a media file. (CVE-2022-45403)\n\n  - Through a series of popup and <code>window.print()</code> calls, an attacker can cause a window to go     fullscreen without the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in potential user confusion or     spoofing attacks. (CVE-2022-45404)\n\n  - Freeing arbitrary <code>nsIInputStream</code>'s on a different thread than creation could have led to a     use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-45405)\n\n  - If an out-of-memory condition occurred when creating a JavaScript global, a JavaScript realm may be     deleted while references to it lived on in a BaseShape. This could lead to a use-after-free causing a     potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-45406)\n\n  - If an attacker loaded a font using <code>FontFace()</code> on a background worker, a use-after-free could     have occurred, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-45407)\n\n  - Through a series of popups that reuse windowName, an attacker can cause a window to go fullscreen without     the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.\n    (CVE-2022-45408)\n\n  - The garbage collector could have been aborted in several states and zones and     <code>GCRuntime::finishCollection</code> may not have been called, leading to a use-after-free and     potentially exploitable crash (CVE-2022-45409)\n\n  - When a ServiceWorker intercepted a request with <code>FetchEvent</code>, the origin of the request was     lost after the ServiceWorker took ownership of it.  This had the effect of negating SameSite cookie     protections.  This was addressed in the spec and then in browsers. (CVE-2022-45410)\n\n  - Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method, allowing an XSS     attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies     protected by HTTPOnly).  To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and     XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-     Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again.  Firefox has applied     the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. (CVE-2022-45411)\n\n  - When resolving a symlink such as <code>file:///proc/self/fd/1</code>, an error message may be produced     where the symlink was resolved to a string containing unitialized memory in the buffer.  This bug only     affects Firefox on Unix-based operated systems (Android, Linux, MacOS). Windows is unaffected.\n    (CVE-2022-45412)\n\n  - Using the <code>S.browserfallbackurl parameter</code> parameter, an attacker could redirect a user to a     URL and cause SameSite=Strict cookies to be sent. This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other     operating systems are not affected. (CVE-2022-45413)\n\n  - A flaw in XML parsing could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. In     official releases of Firefox this vulnerability is mitigated by wasm sandboxing; versions managed by Linux     distributions may have other settings. (CVE-2022-40674)\n\n  - When downloading an HTML file, if the title of the page was formatted as a filename with a malicious     extension, Firefox may have saved the file with that extension, leading to possible system compromise if     the downloaded file was later ran. (CVE-2022-45415)\n\n  - Keyboard events reference strings like KeyA that were at fixed, known, and widely-spread addresses.\n    Cache-based timing attacks such as Prime+Probe could have possibly figured out which keys were being     pressed. (CVE-2022-45416)\n\n  - Service Workers did not detect Private Browsing Mode correctly in all cases, which could have led to     Service Workers being written to disk for websites visited in Private Browsing Mode.  This would not have     persisted them in a state where they would run again, but it would have leaked Private Browsing Mode     details to disk. (CVE-2022-45417)\n\n  - If a custom mouse cursor is specified in CSS, under certain circumstances the cursor could have been drawn     over the browser UI, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks. (CVE-2022-45418)\n\n  - If the user added a security exception for an invalid TLS certificate, opened an ongoing TLS connection     with a server that used that certificate, and then deleted the exception, Firefox would have kept the     connection alive, making it seem like the certificate was still trusted. (CVE-2022-45419)\n\n  - Using tables inside of an iframe, an attacker could have caused iframe contents to be rendered outside the     boundaries of the iframe, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.

The supported version that is     affected is Java SE: 8u301. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access     via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized     ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Java SE as well as unauthorized update,     insert or delete access to some of Java SE accessible data and unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE     accessible data. This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web     Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the     internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments,     typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).     (CVE-2021-3517)\n\n  - Vulnerability in the Java SE product of Oracle Java SE (component: Deployment). The supported version that is     affected is Java SE: 8u301. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access     via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than     the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE. This vulnerability     applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java     applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for     security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted     code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). (CVE-2021-35560)\n\n  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Libraries).     Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 8u301, 11.0.12, 17; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.3 and     21.2.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via Kerberos to     compromise Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person     other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition, attacks may     significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access     to critical data or complete access to all Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data.

An     attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability     could use it to bypass security logic intended to ensure     that a user-provided URL belonged to a specific hostname     or a subdomain of that hostname. This could be used to     cause privileged communication to be made to an     untrusted service as if it was a trusted service.\n    (CVE-2019-0657)\n\n  - A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in     Microsoft Edge handles whitelisting. Edge depends on a     default whitelist of sites where Adobe Flash will load     without user interaction. Because the whitelist was not     scheme-aware, an attacker could use a man in the middle     attack to cause Flash policies to be bypassed and     arbitrary Flash content to be loaded without user     interaction. The security update addresses the     vulnerability by modifying how affected Microsoft Edge     handles whitelisting. (CVE-2019-0641)\n\n  - A spoofing vulnerability exists when Microsoft browsers     improperly handles specific redirects. An attacker who     successfully exploited this vulnerability could trick a     user into believing that the user was on a legitimate     website.

SE or Java for Business installed on the remote host is prior to 7 Update 321, 8 Update 311, 11 Update 13, or 17 Update 1. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the October 2021 CPU advisory:\n\n  - Vulnerability in the Java SE product of Oracle Java SE (component: JavaFX (libxml)). The supported version that is     affected is Java SE: 8u301. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access     via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized     ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Java SE as well as unauthorized update,     insert or delete access to some of Java SE accessible data and unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE     accessible data. This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web     Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the     internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments,     typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).     (CVE-2021-3517)\n\n  - Vulnerability in the Java SE product of Oracle Java SE (component: Deployment). The supported version that is     affected is Java SE: 8u301. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access     via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than     the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE. This vulnerability     applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java     applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for     security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted     code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). (CVE-2021-35560)\n\n  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Libraries).     Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 8u301, 11.0.12, 17; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.3 and     21.2.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via Kerberos to     compromise Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person     other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition, attacks may     significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access     to critical data or complete access to all Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data.

This bug only affects Firefox for Android.\n    Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2023-28159)\n\n  - By displaying a prompt with a long description, the fullscreen notification could have been hidden,     resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.  This bug only affects Firefox for Android.\n    Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2023-25748)\n\n  - Android applications with unpatched vulnerabilities can be launched from a browser using Intents, exposing     users to these vulnerabilities. Firefox will now confirm with users that they want to launch an external     application before doing so.  This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other versions of Firefox are     unaffected. (CVE-2023-25749)\n\n  - Under certain circumstances, a ServiceWorker's offline cache may have leaked to the file system when using     private browsing mode. (CVE-2023-25750)\n\n  - Sometimes, when invalidating JIT code while following an iterator, the newly generated code could be     overwritten incorrectly. This could lead to a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2023-25751)\n\n  - When following a redirect to a publicly accessible web extension file, the URL may have been translated to     the actual local path, leaking potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2023-28160)\n\n  - Dragging a URL from a cross-origin iframe that was removed during the drag could have lead to user     confusion and website spoofing attacks. (CVE-2023-28164)\n\n  - If temporary one-time permissions, such as the ability to use the Camera, were granted to a document     loaded using a file: URL, that permission persisted in that tab for all other documents loaded from a     file: URL. This is potentially dangerous if the local files came from different sources, such as in a     download directory. (CVE-2023-28161)\n\n  - While implementing on AudioWorklets, some code may have casted one type to another, invalid, dynamic type.\n    This could have lead to a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2023-28162)\n\n  - When accessing throttled streams, the count of available bytes needed to be checked in the calling     function to be within bounds. This may have lead future code to be incorrect and vulnerable.\n    (CVE-2023-25752)\n\n  - When downloading files through the Save As dialog on Windows with suggested filenames containing     environment variable names, Windows would have resolved those in the context of the current user.  This     bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other versions of Firefox are unaffected. (CVE-2023-28163)\n\n  - Mozilla developers Timothy Nikkel, Andrew McCreight, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety     bugs present in Firefox 110 and Firefox ESR 102.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption     and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.\n    (CVE-2023-28176)\n\n  - Mozilla developers and community members Calixte Denizet, Gabriele Svelto, Andrew McCreight, and the     Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 110. Some of these bugs showed     evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been     exploited to run arbitrary code.

This bug only affects Firefox for Windows. Other operating     systems are unaffected. (CVE-2022-22746)\n\n  - When navigating from inside an iframe while requesting fullscreen access, an attacker-controlled tab could     have made the browser unable to leave fullscreen mode. (CVE-2022-22743)\n\n  - When inserting text while in edit mode, some characters might have lead to out-of-bounds memory access     causing a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-22742)\n\n  - When resizing a popup while requesting fullscreen access, the popup would have become unable to leave     fullscreen mode.

This could     have lead to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2022-22740)\n\n  - Applying a CSS filter effect could have accessed out of bounds memory. This could have lead to a heap-     buffer-overflow causing a potentially exploitable crash.
