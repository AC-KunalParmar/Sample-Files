There may have been a protocol failure that prevented authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials for the authentication protocol may be invalid. See plugin output for error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for   valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not   another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.","N/A","","SSH was detected on port 22 but no credentials were provided.

The following HTTP methods are considered insecure:

Many frameworks and languages treat 'HEAD' as a 'GET' request, albeit one without any body in the response. If a security constraint was set on 'GET' requests such that only 'authenticatedUsers' could access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be bypassed for the 'HEAD' version. This allowed unauthorized blind submission of any privileged GET request.

As this list may be incomplete, the plugin also tests - if 'Thorough tests' are enabled or 'Enable web applications tests' is set to 'yes' in the scan policy - various known HTTP methods on each directory and considers them as unsupported if it receives a response code of 400, 403, 405, or 501.
