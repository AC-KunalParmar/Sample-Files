-GitLab SAST-

GitLab SAST integrates into GitLab's Continuous Integration and leverages FLOSS scanning tools for the most common languages (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks>). It then reads the results of those tools and creates a report in a common JSON format.
