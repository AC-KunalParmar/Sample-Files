This vulnerability affects Bluetooth HID Hosts in BlueZ, with an example affected package being bluez 5.64-0ubuntu1 in Ubuntu 22.04LTS. Another vulnerability in multiple UNIX-based products allows a remote attacker to gain elevated privileges by exploiting a keystroke injection vulnerability in the HID Profile of multiple Bluetooth host stacks. By tricking the Bluetooth host state-machine into pairing with a fake keyboard without user confirmation, the attacker can connect to vulnerable devices and transmit keystrokes to install apps and run arbitrary commands with elevated privileges. Additionally, BlueZ does not properly restrict non-bonded devices from injecting HID events into the input subsystem, allowing a physically proximate attacker to inject keystrokes and execute arbitrary commands while the device is discoverable. Impact: If exploited, these vulnerabilities could result in unauthorized access to systems, injection of malicious HID messages, installation of unauthorized apps, execution of arbitrary commands with elevated privileges, and compromise of affected systems. Remediation: Apply the latest patches and updates provided by the respective vendors. AdditionalInformation: CVE-2020-0556 mitigation may have already addressed the Bluetooth HID Hosts issue.

This attack allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks and downgrade or disable security features. It affects OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products. The vulnerability occurs due to mishandling of the handshake phase and sequence numbers. Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to the bypass of security features like ChaCha20-Poly1305 and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC. Various SSH implementations are affected, including OpenSSH, PuTTY, Paramiko, FileZilla, and more. The impact of this vulnerability is the potential compromise of connection security and the ability to disable certain security features. Upgrading to OpenSSH 9.6 or higher is recommended. Impact: If exploited, this vulnerability can lead to the downgrading or disabling of security features in SSH connections. This can result in the compromise of connection security and the potential for unauthorized access or data interception. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to bypass integrity checks and manipulate the SSH protocol, leading to the compromise of sensitive information or unauthorized system access. Remediation: Apply the latest patches and updates provided by the respective vendors. AdditionalInformation: This vulnerability requires an active Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker who can intercept and modify the connection's traffic at the TCP/IP layer. The attack allows the deletion of consecutive messages, which can lead to a stalled connection. The most significant impact is the ability to disable the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message, affecting keystroke timing obfuscation features.

These vulnerabilities include a flaw in the Kerberos component of Windows, which could be exploited by a remote attacker to gain administrative privileges. Samba, on the other hand, has several vulnerabilities that could be used by a remote attacker to escalate privileges, execute arbitrary code, or bypass bad password lockouts. These vulnerabilities affect various versions of Ubuntu and can be fixed by updating to the specified package versions. Additionally, there is a vulnerability in Fedora that allows an attacker to set PAC ticket signature as optional. Upgrading to the latest version of the affected software is recommended to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Impact: If these vulnerabilities are exploited, an attacker could gain elevated privileges, bypass security measures, execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service. This could result in unauthorized access to sensitive information, unauthorized modification of data, or disruption of services. Remediation: For the Windows Kerberos vulnerability, Microsoft has not specified a specific version to upgrade to. It is recommended to keep the system up to date with the latest security patches. For the Samba vulnerabilities, Ubuntu users should upgrade to the following package versions: samba-testsuite - 2:4.13.17~dfsg-0ubuntu1.20.04.4, samba - 2:4.13.17~dfsg-0ubuntu1.20.04.4, libnss-winbind - 2:4.13.17~dfsg-0ubuntu1.20.04.4, libpam-winbind - 2:4.13.17~dfsg-0ubuntu1.20.04.4, winbind - 2:4.13.17~dfsg-0ubuntu1.20.04.4, smbclient - 2:4.13.17~dfsg-0ubuntu1.20.04.4, libwbclient-dev - 2:4.13.17~dfsg-0ubuntu1.20.04.4, libsmbclient - 2:4.13.17~dfsg-0ubuntu1.20.04.4, python3-samba - 2:4.13.17~dfsg-0ubuntu1.20.04.4, samba-common-bin - 2:4.13.17~dfsg-0ubuntu1.20.04.4, libwbclient0 - 2:4.13.17~dfsg-0ubuntu1.20.04.4, samba-dsdb-modules - 2:4.13.17~dfsg-0ubuntu1.20.04.4, samba-dev - 2:4.13.17~dfsg-0ubuntu1.20.04.4, libsmbclient-dev - 2:4.13.17~dfsg-0ubuntu1.20.04.4, samba-vfs-modules - 2:4.13.17~dfsg-0ubuntu1.20.04.4, samba-common - 2:4.13.17~dfsg-0ubuntu1.20.04.4, ctdb - 2:4.13.17~dfsg-0ubuntu1.20.04.4, samba-libs - 2:4.13.17~dfsg-0ubuntu1.20.04.4, registry-tools - 2:4.13.17~dfsg-0ubuntu1.20.04.4. For the Fedora vulnerability, upgrading to the latest version (1.21) is recommended.

This attack allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks and downgrade or disable security features. It affects OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products. The vulnerability occurs due to mishandling of the handshake phase and sequence numbers. Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to the bypass of security features like ChaCha20-Poly1305 and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC. Various SSH implementations are affected, including OpenSSH, PuTTY, Paramiko, FileZilla, and more. The impact of this vulnerability is the potential compromise of connection security and the ability to disable certain security features. Upgrading to OpenSSH 9.6 or higher is recommended. Impact: If exploited, this vulnerability can lead to the downgrading or disabling of security features in SSH connections. This can result in the compromise of connection security and the potential for unauthorized access or data interception. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to bypass integrity checks and manipulate the SSH protocol, leading to the compromise of sensitive information or unauthorized system access.

The first vulnerability is a security feature bypass in ADFS, which could allow an attacker to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access. The second vulnerability is in the Azure Active Directory component of Microsoft Windows, which could allow a local authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. Impact: If these vulnerabilities are exploited, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, compromise the integrity of the system, and execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, and potential system compromise. Remediation: For the ADFS vulnerability, Microsoft has released a security update. It is recommended to upgrade to the latest version of ADFS to mitigate this vulnerability. For the Azure Active Directory vulnerability, Microsoft has not specified a specific version to upgrade to. It is recommended to regularly update the operating system and apply all available security patches to mitigate this vulnerability.
