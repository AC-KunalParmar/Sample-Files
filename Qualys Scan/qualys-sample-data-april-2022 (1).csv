It is part of the Apache Logging Services, a project of the Apache Software Foundation. 
The JMSAppender in Log4j 1.2 is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration. 
 The attacker can provide TopicBindingName and TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName configurations causing JMSAppender to perform JNDI requests that result in remote code execution in a similar fashion to CVE-2021-44228. 

 Affected versions: 
Log4j version 1.2  

 QID Detection: (Authenticated) - Linux 
This detection is based on querying the OS package managers on the target. If the target has a log4j package with a version in 1.2, the target is flagged as potentially vulnerable. 

QID Detection: (Authenticated) - Windows 
On Windows system, the QID identifies vulnerable instance of log4j via WMI to check log4j included in the running processes via command-line.",Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to  remote code execution (RCE) on the target.,"Customers are advised to upgrade their Log4j to the version in 2.16. If updating the version is not possible, please refer to the mitigations mentioned here Log4j (https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html). Workaround: Audit your logging configuration to ensure it has no JMSAppender configured. Log4j 1.2 configurations without JMSAppender are not impacted by this vulnerability. 
Log4j 1.x does not have Lookups, so the risk is lower. Applications using Log4j 1.x are only vulnerable to this attack when they use JNDI in their configuration.

SMB signing is a security mechanism in the SMB protocol and is also known as security signatures. SMB signing is designed to help improve the security of the SMB protocol.
 
SMB signing adds security to a network using NetBIOS, avoiding man-in-the-middle attacks.

This checks from the registry value of RequireSecuritySignature and EnableSecuritySignature form  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkStation\Parameters for client  and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSetServices\LanmanServer\Parameters for servers to check if SMB signing is required or enabled or disabled.

The complete detection logic is explained above.","Unauthorized users sniffing the network could catch many challenge/response exchanges and replay the whole thing to grab particular session keys, and then authenticate on the Domain Controller.","Without SMB signing, a device could intercept SMB network packets from an originating computer, alter their contents, and broadcast them to the destination computer. Since, digitally signing the packets enables the recipient of the packets to confirm their point of origination and their authenticity, it is recommended that SMB signing is enabled and required.

It can be used to remotely log in and interact with a Windows machine.

It is possible to configure RDP to use encryption algorithms that are considered insecure, such as RC4 40bit and RC4 56 bit.",If an attacker has access to the network traffic with RDP sessions using weak encryption methods it's possible to bruteforce the encryption parameters and compromise privacy of the RDP session.,"RDP needs to be configured to use strong encryption methods or use SSL as the privacy and integrity provider. 
To configure RDP encryption methods 'Terminal Services Configuration' or 'Remote Desktop Session Host Configuration' snap-in can be launched in mmc.exe. 
In 'Terminal Services Configuration' or 'Remote Desktop Session Host Configuration' properties dialog box General tab for the Encryption Level 'High' should be selected.
 
On Windows XP the RDP configuration can be found under  Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Terminal Services and User Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Terminal Services.  Under Encryption and Security item, double click on 'Set client connection encryption level' and enable the policy and select high for the 'Encryption level'.

Run the following: 
Get-Service -Name Spooler 
If the Print Spooler is running or if the service is not set to disabled, select one of the following options to either disable the Print Spooler service, or to Disable inbound remote printing through Group Policy: 

Option 1 - Disable the Print Spooler service: 
If disabling the Print Spooler service is appropriate for your enterprise, use the following PowerShell commands:
Stop-Service -Name Spooler -Force 
Set-Service -Name Spooler -StartupType Disabled 
Impact of workaround: Disabling the Print Spooler service disables the ability to print both locally and remotely. 

Option 2 - Disable inbound remote printing through Group Policy: 
You can also configure the settings via Group Policy as follows: 
Computer Configuration / Administrative Templates / Printers 
Disable the ""Allow Print Spooler to accept client connections:"" policy to block remote attacks. 
Impact of workaround This policy will block the remote attack vector by preventing inbound remote printing operations. The system will no longer function as a print server, but local printing to a directly attached device will still be possible.
