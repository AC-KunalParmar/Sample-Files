If you define permissions with protection level of signature, you will only allow applications which have been signed with the same key as your application to send intent to or use your component (This includes content providers).\n\nDefine permission in the first application:\n\n    <permission android:label=\"...\" android:name=\"your.package.app.permission.READ_PERMISSION\" android:protectionLevel=\"signature\"/>\n\nand use the permission in the second application:\n\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"your.package.app.permission.READ_PERMISSION\"/>\n\nFor more information see [Android documentation on permission](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/permission-element.html).\n\n- In Android 5 (LOLLIPOP) and later, you can not install an app that defines a custom permission with a name that is already defined by another installed app. Make your custom permissions unique to your app, by appending the name to the full package name of your app (in Android 4.4 and before, it was possible to define permissions with the same name in different applications even if they were not signed by the same key, however the protection level of the permission was decided by the first installed app). For more information see [Uniqueness Requirement for Custom Permissions](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-5.0-changes.html#custom_permissions).\n\n- As stated in the task, you can define permissions for your components to prevent any other components that don't have those permissions from talking to your component. For example you can define CAMERA permission (android:permission) for the following _Activity_ which means that only components that have CAMERA permission can send Intent to the _Activity_ (in AndroidManifest.xml):\n\n        <activity android:name=\".myComponent\" \n                    android:permission=\"android.permission.CAMERA\" >    \n        <intent-filter>\n        <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.CAMERA_BUTTON\" />                \n        <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" />          \n        </intent-filter>        \n        </activity>\n\nor for a Service (or other Android components such as content providers (<provider>) and broadcast receivers (<receiver>)):\n\n         <service android:name=\".mySMSService\" android:enabled=\"true\"\n          android:permission=\"android.permission.READ_SMS\"> </service>\n\nFor more information [see 'Enforcing Permissions in AndroidManifest.xml'](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html#manifest).\n",

An example of this is Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC), which does the following:\n\n* Takes a hash of read-only fields before sending them to the client.\n* Encrypts the hash with a secret key stored on the server.\n* Adds the hashed and encrypted value to the form as an additional hidden field.\n* Rehashes and re-encrypts the read-only client-supplied parameters, and compares this with the client-supplied HMAC parameter.\n* Any difference between them indicates that one or more of the read-only parameters have been tampered with.",

                "title": "Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
                "text": "Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is the result of an attacker forging a crafted request from a vulnerable application on the server side. This attack is usually carried out to exploit other services running on the vulnerable application's server, or the resources publicly available on that server's intranet. It is usually difficult to get the vulnerable application to send requests to the Internet due to firewall settings. This attack is possible when the attacker has partial or full access over the HTTP request.\n\nConsider the following vulnerable PHP code:\n\n    if (isset($_GET['url'])) { \n        $url = $_GET['url'];\n    }\n    $image = fopen($url, 'rb');\n    fpassthru($image); }\n\nIn this code, the application makes a request using a `url` that can be controlled by the attacker. The `url` is used to fetch an image from the specified location. When an attacker carefully crafts a `url` like this, it affects all of the requests that follow. When these requests are handled by the vulnerable PHP code above, they are made on behalf of and relayed to the attacker using the `url`. All the following GET requests consist of the crafted `url` and the HOST header (`example.com`, where the PHP code is being served). \n\n- *Apache HTTP Server Status:*\n```\nGET /?url=http://localhost/server-status HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com\n```\n In the above request, the `url` is set to fetch information about the Apache HTTP Servers status. The response returned by the above PHP code (and relayed to the attacker) contains the Apache HTTP Server Status that is serving that code, given `mod_status` is enabled on that server (it is enabled by default).\n\n- *Accessing the unauthenticated information/services available on the Intranet:*\n```\nGET /?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com\n```\n The `url` in the above request is set to fetch cloud metadata. The IP address `169.254.169.254` is the standard address used by Amazon EC2 and other cloud providers for distributing metadata to cloud instances.\n\n- *Performing port scans on internal networks and gathering information about it:* by feeding different IP and port combinations into the `url` parameter in the above PHP code, an attacker can obtain valuable information regarding the intranet on which the web server hosting that code resides. The following table gives some examples of the kind of information someone can gather from the HTTP error codes and the latencies of responses:\n\n| **URL (IP+Port)** | **HTTP Response Code** | **Round-Trip delay Time** |\n|--|--|--|--|\n| http://localhost:22 | 200 | 10 (ms) | The port is open! |\n| http://localhost:23 | 500 | 10 (ms) | The port is closed. |\n| http://10.0.0.1/ | 500 | 30010 (ms) | It is blocked by a firewall or unable to route. |\n| http://10.0.0.1:8080/ | 500 | 10 (ms) | Port is closed, but traffic is routed to that address. |\n\n- *Using other URl schemes to access files on a local system or internal network:*\n```\nGET /?url=file:///etc/passwd HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com\n```\n In the above request, the `url` fed into the vulnerable php code uses a `file://` scheme to access the local files the php application may have access to. In this example, the attacker is attempting to access the `passwd` file. Depending on how the HTTP requests are made in the code, one may be able to exploit the features available with the requesting utility (for instance, cURL, fopen(), dict URL, where `fopen()` is used in the above PHP code):\n```\nGET /?url=dict://localhost:11211/stat HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com\n```\n In the above request, the `dict://` URI scheme is used. Port *11211* is the default port used by Memcached, which normally grants unauthenticated access to the local server users (via the loopback network interface - localhost). Memcached is a utility for speeding up dynamic web applications by caching the data and objects in memory.\n\n\n###External Resources:\n\n1.

This forces the vulnerable application to make a request on behalf of the attacker via its loopback network interface (localhost). If the response contains some information about the hosting (i.e. server banner), then the attack has been successful. This attack can be repeated using other URL payloads such as `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` for fetching cloud meta-data, `http://localhost/server-status` for Apache HTTP Servers' status and so on.\n\n2. Try other URL schemes in the URL, such as Gopher, DICT and SFTP. Set up a virtual private server (VPS) and use its IP when crafting these URLs. When you receive a request (on your VPS), the SSRF attack has been successfully launched. This is because the vulnerable application has made a request to your VPS on your behalf. Alternatively, you can try the `file:///etc/passwd` URI payload and see if `passwd` is relayed back to you by the vulnerable application.\n\nFor a comprehensive list of SSRF attacks, see the [SSRF Bible Cheatsheet](https://github.com/jivoi/offsec_pdfs/blob/master/SSRF-Bible-Cheatsheet.pdf).",

                        "text": "SSRF attacks do not often trigger a response directly back to the web application but still may be vulnerable to SSRF. Blind SSRF occurs when an application can be forced to trigger a back-end HTTP request, but as a tester or attacker you have no knowledge of the response. To test for blind SSRF, it is a best practice to utilize an out-of-band technique that requires  an external server capable of receiving HTTP requests be set up. This server should be under your control.\n\n1. Configure a public-facing web server with an IP address and domain name. If using Burp, the tool Burp Collaborator may be used to set this up quickly.\n\n2. Identify an injection point in the web application to test for blind SSRF (similar to testing for regular SSRF). Enter your IP address or domain name as the server.\n\n3. View the logs in your server and search for requests coming from the target application. If you see log entries that are aligned with the vulnerable application, it is susceptible to blind SSRF and further scans can begin to enumerate the internal network or load a malicious file from your server.",

                    "text": "The Android platform provides support for inter-process communication through **Intents**. Intents are sent within or between applications. They can be sent either explicitly (an application can target a specific application component) or implicitly (via the Android system). To secure an application's IPC endpoints you must control access to both types of Intents:\n\n**Limit and restrict exposure:**\n\nReview the application's manifest file, `AndroidManifest.xml` and examine each application component's definition. The relevant XML nodes are: `<activity>`, `<activity-alias>`, `<service>`, and `<receiver>` XML nodes:\n\n- If a component should not accept communication external to the application make sure the `android:exported` attribute is set to `false`.\n- Examine a component's `IntentFilters` by analyzing the XML node `<intent-filter>`. `IntentFilters` instruct the Android system to which Intents the application responds. When an Android application sends an implicit Intent the Android system will send it to any application component which has this Intent listed in their `IntentFilters`.  Reduce or eliminate the component's `IntentFilters` to minimize external communication via implicit Intents. Note that `IntentFilters` is NOT a security control as an Intent can be sent successfully as an explicit Intent.\n- Control access to a component by specifying the `android:permission` attribute. This attribute specifies which permission clients must have in order to launch or communicate with the component. Define application-specific security controls by declaring new permissions in the application's manifest.\n\nFor more information regarding the manifest file consult the references below.\n\n**Eliminate process impersonation:**\n\nIf your application provides callback functionality accept `PendingIntent` but not `Intent` from the requester. `PendingIntents` are sent as the process which created them rather than process sending them. Requiring their use by clients will prevent tricking your application to send an Intent to another process. For more information about PendingIntents refer to the [PendingIntent documentation](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PendingIntent.html) online.\n\n**Validate all received data:**\n\nRegardless of security controls used, the Android platform does NOT perform any sanity check on the data sent with Intents. An application must validate all data before accepting it. Where possible, perform whitelist (known good character, acceptable values) validation.\n\nAndroid manifest references:\n\n- [Manifest overview](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html)\n- [Activity](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html)\n- [Activity Alias](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-alias-element.html)\n- [Intent Filters](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element.html)\n- [Service](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/service-element.html)\n- [Receiver](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/receiver-element.html)\n- [Permission](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/permission-element.html)",

In this verification, the application is declaring a URL scheme in the form `myapp://` within its Android manifest file for handling URL requests.\n\n2.

Create an HTML file with this content, open it in the Chrome browser, and click on the link: `<a href='myapp://'>LINK!</a>`\n    - Alternatively, you can set `window.location` in Javascript when the page is loaded.\n\n4. This test __fails__ if the application performs an important action after opening without notifying the user and asking for permission.\n    - Examples of important actions are making phone calls, sending SMS, and changing contacts.\n\n5. This test completes if the application is not acting on any data received with the URL. \n\n6. If it is receiving input through URL parameters, such as `myapp://somedata?someactions`, work with developers to verify that data validation is performed on data. This part of the test is application dependent and depends on the expected data.\n    - Create a link with data in an unintended format.\n\n    This test __fails__ if the input is not rejected (or ignored).",

Do not ignore such values. For example a file creation object may return the status code of the operation and indicate the success or failure.\n\n- Always provide remote systems/users with a __generic error message__ that does not reveal internal system details, such as a stack trace, working directory, or core dump.\n\n- __Centralize__ the process of __error message generation__.\n    - A class or property-file can contain the text of all returned error messages with various parameters.\n\n- Set application and server configurations to provide __minimum details in error messages__.\n    - Especially when an unhandled exception or error occurs that is not explicitly caught by the application.\n    - For example, when an application server handles part of the messages before reaching your application.\n\n- In some cases, the server may provide a facility to catch all errors before forwarding to the remote system.\n    - In other cases, the application will need to explicitly develop a handler that catches any errors before redirecting them to the remote system.\n        - The advantage here is that the application can log the error with a unique ID, create a generic message to the remote system, and include the unique ID in the response.\n        - This allows application support personnel to troubleshoot an issue without revealing system details to remote systems.\n\n- Do not explicitly specify the __underlying reason for an error__ when a number of reasons could have caused it.\n    - This is especially important when that information could be used for more directed attacks.\n    - A typical example is returning different errors for wrong usernames or wrong passwords, which allows for __user enumeration__ attacks.\n\n- Do not include any __sensitive data__ in error messages.\n    - This is especially important when error messages are logged.\n\n- __Sign and encrypt__ detailed error messages when they are required by a specific remote system.\n    - Use a set of mutual keys to encrypt the information.\n    - The receiving system can also request a signature and verify the signature to verify the authenticity of the errors.",

You can call the `java.net.URL` class using a URI that starts with `https://` to use the HTTP-over-TLS (HTTPS) secured communication. Alternative interfaces includes `javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection` and `org.apache.http.client.HttpClient` when used with a URI that starts with `https://` (Android Marshmallow does not support Apache HTTP client. In order to use Apache HTTP APIs, if really needed, specify this in the build.gradle file (compile-time dependency): `android { useLibrary 'org.apache.http.legacy' }`).\n\n- For custom protocols that use TLS, you can use the `SSLSocketFactory` from the `javax.net.ssl` package to make a `SSLSocket`. However, it is extremely crucial to explicitly validate the certificate's common name before sending the data. Unlike HTTPS, the certificate will not be validated against the peer's host name. See the code example below as a sample of how to validate the host name explicitly.\n\n- Note that, the following changes took place in **Android O**:\n    - ```HttpURLConnection``` normalizes URL's containing empty paths by appending a slash at the end of them. \n    - ```HttpsURLConnection``` does not allow insecure TLS/SSL fallback.\n\n## Code\n\nFor HTTPS protocols:\n\n-- src/com/example/androidssl/AndroidSSL.java\n\n```\n// Use the URL class to handle https protocol\nURL url = new URL(eText.getText().toString());\nURLConnection conn = url.openConnection();\n\n// Get the response\nBufferedReader rd = new BufferedReader(new\n    InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));\nString line = \"\";\nwhile ((line = rd.readLine()) != null) {\n    Message lmsg;\n    lmsg = new Message();\n    lmsg.obj = line;\n    lmsg.what = 0;\n    AndroidSSL.this.h.sendMessage(lmsg);\n}\nDownload the Complete Code Exampledownload link\n\nFor general SSL-based communication other than HTTP:\n```\n-- src/com/example/androidssl/AndroidSSL.java\n```\nSSLContext ssl_context = SSLContext.getInstance(\"TLS\");\nssl_context.init(null, null, null);\nSSLSocketFactory socketFactory = ssl_context.getSocketFactory();\n\n// Get the host part\nString [] parts = eText.getText().toString().split(\"//\");\nString host = parts[parts.length-1];\n\n// Create a SSL Socket\nSSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket)socketFactory.createSocket(host, DEFAULT_SSL_PORT);\nsocket.setSoTimeout(20000);\nsocket.setUseClientMode(true);\nsocket.startHandshake();\n\n/*\n * Here we validate the common name (CN) of the peer's certificate against\n * the expected host name. Without this, the any valid certificate can be\n * used by the attacker or the man in the middle!!\n * Since it is not HTTP-based SSL, the library code does not have a way\n * to validate the certificate's CN.\n */\nPrincipal peer_principal = socket.getSession().getPeerPrincipal();\nif (peer_principal.getName().indexOf(\"CN=\" + EXPECTED_HOST + \",\") == -1) {\n    Message lmsg;\n    lmsg = new Message();\n    lmsg.obj = \"ERROR: Host not matching \" + EXPECTED_HOST;\n    lmsg.what = 0;\n    AndroidSSL.this.h.sendMessage(lmsg);\n    return;\n}\n\n// Send a sample simple request to get the content\nsocket.getOutputStream().write(\"GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\\r\\n\".getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));\n\n// Get the response\nBufferedReader rd = new BufferedReader(new\n    InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\nString line = \"\";\nwhile ((line = rd.readLine()) != null) {\n    Message lmsg;\n    lmsg = new Message();\n    lmsg.obj = line;\n    lmsg.what = 0;\n    AndroidSSL.this.h.sendMessage(lmsg);\n}\n```\n[Download the Complete Code Example](https://preview.sdelements.com/static//code/Android/AndroidSSL.zip)",

This developer tool detects and logs a number of events such as accidental network and disk accesses. *StrictMode* is more of a performance monitoring tool and is not considered a security mechanism.

                "description": "Add `SameSite` attribute to the session cookie in your application, or even all cookies.\n\nThis advice is applicable if your application:\n\n* Uses cookies to maintain a session or propagate authorization information\n* Your application works in an isolated fashion, without relying on cross-site or cross-origin requests\n\nMore details are provided below.\n\n## The purpose of the SameSite attribute\n\nThe browser automatically attaches cookies on outgoing requests. This enables web applications to keep the history and preferences of the users and perform session management. \n\nHowever, if a malicious page triggers a request to an application's backend, the browser also attaches the cookie. If such a request triggers a state-changing operation (e.g., post an update on a social media platform), we are talking about *Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)*.\n\nThe `SameSite` attribute helps prevent CSRF. When present, the browser will only send the cookie on *same site requests*. In essence, the cookie will be present on every request that originates within the domain (e.g., from `https://one.example.com` to `https://one.example.com` or to `https://two.example.com`). However, the cookie will not be present on cross-site requests (e.g., from `https://www.evil.com` to `https://one.example.com`). When the cookie is missing, the application cannot perform the operation in the user's name, and the CSRF attack is mitigated.\n\n\n## Lax vs Strict mode\n\nThe `SameSite` attribute can be configured in two modes:\n\n* `Set-Cookie: username=Joe; SameSite=Strict;`\n* `Set-Cookie: username=Joe; SameSite=Lax;`\n\n\nIn `Strict` mode, the cookie will never be sent on cross-site requests. This mode is the default setting when only the attribute name with no value is provided.\n\nIn `Lax` mode, the cookie will never be sent on cross-site reuqests, except for top-level navigational GET requests (requests that change the URL in the browser's address bar). Such requests occur when the user clicks a link that navigates the page to your application. Without `Lax` mode, the cookies would be missing and the user would be logged out, even if a session existed before.\n\n__Both configurations stop CSRF attacks. For private enterprise applications, `Strict` mode is likely to work well. Public applications can use `Lax` mode if needed.__\n\n__*Note 1:*__ Some applications depend on cross-site requests for legitimate features. Those applications are incompatible with the `SameSite` attribute and should rely on other CSRF defenses instead  ([T29](/library/tasks/T29/)).\n\n__*Note 2:*__ The `SameSite` attribute is a recent addition to the web security landscape. Older browser versions, as well as Internet Explorer, do not support it. Therefore, it is not yet recommended to use this attribute as a primary CSRF defense. __If your application is vulnerable to CSRF, you must also implement another CSRF defense__ ([T29](/library/tasks/T29/)).",

                "description": "Follow these guidelines to secure data shared between Android applications:\n \n - __Use `Intent` objects when sharing a small amount of data__:\n    - `Intent` objects are the primary mechanism to secure sharing small amounts of data between Android applications.\n    - To learn how to send data along with `Intent` objects to another application, see the Android developer article [Sending Simple Data to Other Apps](https://developer.android.com/training/sharing/send.html).\n    - Use explicit `Intent` objects and encrypt sensitive data when possible. There is no significant risk with `Intent` communication if the operating system is trusted, so encrypting data is optional.\n\n - __Use `ContentProvider` objects for sharing complex or large data__:\n    - `ContentProvider` objects are the standard way to share complex data. The data is shared through a URI that points to the provider's namespace.\n    - For general information about creating content providers, see the Android developer article [Creating a Content Provider](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-provider-creating.html)).\n            \n        - Define two separate permissions for reading and writing.\n        - If the communication happens between two applications signed by the same key (they are both your applications), use `signature` as the value of `android:protectionLevel`.\n        - Grant more granular permissions by using URI-based permissions. You can specify permissions on a subset of data, for example: `<grant-uri-permission android:path=\"/shared_resources/\">`\n        - You will need to grant permission to particular apps to read the data: `Context.grantUriPermission(\"someApp\", address_link, intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION);`\n        - Avoid SQL Injection attacks by using bind variables and parameterized methods such as `query()` and `update()` instead of concatenating user input to build the query strings. This recommendation for data querying methods remains the same for any content provider.\n\n- __Use `FileProvider` objects for sharing files between applications__:\n    - `FileProvider` is a type of content provider (subclass of `ContentProvider`).\n    - For a detailed description of file sharing in Android, see the Android developer article [Setting Up File Sharing](https://developer.android.com/training/secure-file-sharing/setup-sharing.html).\n    - The other applications that the file is shared with (each called a client) receive a content URI that hides the actual location of the file. Any permissions such as read/write are temporary and specific.\n    - To implement this, you need to use getUriForFile and then grant temporary permission. For more information, see the [getUriForFile section](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/content/FileProvider.html#getUriForFile(android.content.Context, java.lang.String, java.io.File)).\n\n__Avoid__ these approaches to data sharing for any sensitive information:\n\n- __Avoid using `MediaStore` objects for sensitive data__:\n    - Some developers use [MediaStore](https://developer.android.com/training/sharing/send.html) for sharing files. The content of the files will be available to other applications.\n\n- __Avoid writing files that contain sensitive or private data to a shared location and then passing the URI to the client application)__:\n    - From Android 7.0 onward the operating system enforces the `StrictMode` API policy, which means that if an `Intent` containing a file URI leaves any app, the app will get a `FileUriExposedException` exception.\n    - Use the `detectFileUriExposure()` method of the `android.os.StrictMode.VmPolicy.Builder` class to detect any event where your app exposes a `file://` Uri to another app. For more information about *StrictMode*, please see the How-tos section of this countermeasure.\n- __Avoid using shared UIDs for data sharing__:\n    - Shared UIDs have been known to cause non-deterministic behavior in the package manager and should be avoided if possible. If you are using shared UIDs to communicate between your apps, you should consider using instead standard cross-app communication mechanisms such as services and content providers.",

Classify the data according to its importance to the business, and security risk. If a complete data or asset classification model is in place, list the security requirements for that type of data class. These requirements need to be translated into requirements for the cloud-based solution provider to comply.\n2. Request recent independent evaluations of the supplier's security controls around their cloud solution, such as a risk assessment, compliance audit report, or security attestation certificate. Use these sources as inputs for further assessing the current level of risk of the cloud-based solution.\n3. Perform a detailed risk assessment of the cloud-based solution using a Threat and Risk Assessment (TRA) methodology, or use a standard questionnaire of [cloud-based security controls](/library/glossary/G109/) to evaluate the solution's level of security.\n4. Identify all significant risks, gaps, and vulnerabilities. Rank then based on their likelihood of being exploited, and potential impact.\n5. Work with the supplier directly, or indirectly via the business or procurement function liaising with the supplier, to address all risks identified.\n6. Once all identified supplier risks have been mitigated to an acceptable level, establish [contract clauses](/library/glossary/G110/) to ensure that the supplier will maintain their current level of security (or better) over time, and inform the organization if a data breach is detected or suspected. \n7. Establish standard security clauses to be included in all future supplier or vendor agreements. \n8. Document all remaining and residual risks in a risk register, and ensure that they are signed off by a senior business manager. Monitor these risks and review them annually.\n\n__Note__: This countermeasure will not transition to 'Complete' unless its corresponding scan is completed with __zero 'High' and zero 'Critical' findings__.",

It is supported by Android Studio and Eclipse using the Android SDK. Other than obfuscating the code, it shrinks, optimizes and preverifies the processed code as well. It detects and removes the unused classes, fields, methods and attributes from the Java code; optimizes Java bytecode and removes unused instructions; changes the name of the left classes, fields, and methods to something short and meaningless; and preverifies the code for Java 6 or Java Micro Edition.\n\nTo run ProGuard, locate the ProGuard jar in the `lib` directory of the ProGuard distribution. Put required options in a configuration file (say, myconfig.pro), and call:\n\n```\njava -jar proguard.jar @myconfig.pro\n```\n\nThe `-injars class_path` option specifies the input jars (or aars, wars, ears, zips, apks, or directories) of the application to be processed.\n\nFor more details on how to use ProGaurd refer to [ProGuard Manual](https://www.guardsquare.com/proguard/manual).\n\n##Note:\nProprietary tools like DexGuard can provide better obfuscation and protection for your application in exchange for the increased costs to pay for those tools.\n",

Configure the SAST tool to include the entire code base, configuration files, third-party and open-source components, and shared components and libraries.\n3. Where applicable (with a mature development team) add the SAST tool's plug-in to the developer IDE.\n4. Execute SAST routinely on code commit, unit, integration, and regression testing, and after staging the release so that the security team can independently scan static files and component configurations. The frequency and stage at which the scan is performed depends on your pipeline's maturity and team's capacity.\n5. Triage the results and update the scanner profiles to reduce the number of false positives of the following scans. Use [false positive reduction strategies](/library/glossary/G67/) for best results.\n6. Properly document and maintain an inventory of the scanning results and the corresponding actions taken to address the findings.\n7. Identify proper controls to fix discovered vulnerabilities (true positives) permanently.\n8. Include web privacy scans in the SAST process, and track remediation accordingly.\n\n__Note__: This countermeasure will not transition to 'Complete' unless its corresponding scan is run with __zero 'High' and zero 'Critical' findings__.",

Do something\n            }\n\nA similar method `checkCallingOrSelfPermission()` checks if a calling process or the currently active process has a specific permission: \n\n            int result = checkCallingOrSelfPermission(\"android.permission.CAMERA\");\n            if (result==PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED)) { /* do something */ }\n\nUsing the `checkCallingOrSelfPermission()` method can result in improper permission re-delegation (or in other words privilege escalation). A malicious application which uses Intents (or other forms of IPC such as binders) to invoke the developer's application can obtain the called application's permissions to access resources without having those permissions itself so it should be used with care.\n\nDevelopers can also mandate having a permission for any component that receives a broadcast (in the example below, _myIntent_ is only received by those components that have CAMERA permission):\n\n            Intent myIntent = new Intent(MESSAGE_RECEIVED);\n            context.sendBroadcast(myIntent, \"android.permission.CAMERA\");\n",

First, decode the input string:\n\n        String decodedInput = Uri.decode(inputUri.toString());\n\n2. Obtain the resource based on the last part of the decoded string in your intended target folder (parentDirectory):\n\n        File targetFile = new File(parentDirectory, Uri.parse(decodedInput).getLastPathSegment());\n\n3. Note that it is possible that you have landed in another directory if the input is double encoded. Compare the absolute path of a file in the parent directory with this file:\n\n        File f=new File(parentDirectory, \"AKnownFile.txt\");\n        String parentAbsoluteDirectory = f.getAbsolutePath();\n        if targetFile.getCanonicalPath().equals(parentAbsoluteDirectory) ...\n\n4.

This is an iterative procedure and is best described [here](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#page-33).\n    - You should remove '../' and './' from the __FileLocation__ in each step and move to the next path segment (segments are separated by slashes).\n    - Note that just replacing '../' with '/', as some developers attempt to, is not enough. If you do, '..../' will end up being '../'.\n    - Also, you cannot remove all '..' in the name, as __FileLocation__ could include double dots (/file..txt).\n\n- Now that you have removed path traversal characters (dot segments), add __FileLocation__ to the root folder (/public).\n\n- Verify that the final absolute path is equal to one of the folders in your white-list (for example /public).

A remote attacker might be able to control the resource location and cause the application to retrieve and/or execute potentially unsafe resources from outside the user's authorized territory.\n\nA recommended approach is to wrap all access points to local resources in the application with a security control function that calculates the final location of the resource by resolving all the relative paths. Then validate that the final location of the resource falls within the approved white-listed locations within the workspace of the program. See the How-to's section for more details.\n\n__Note:__\n\nThe temporary directory of the system might be shared between several programs. Due to easy and unrestricted access by other applications, access to this directory must be prohibited, or the workspace must be restricted to a hardened sub-directory that limits access permissions to just your application.",

                        "text": "The *”Multi-level Protection Scheme (MLPS)”*, a supporting regulation to Article 21 of the Chinese cybersecurity framework, requires all network operators to perform a maturity assessment to classify the security of networks and implement technical measures to ensure the network is free from interference, damage, or unauthorized access. \n\nNetwork Operators refer to owners and administrators of networks and network service providers. The compliance procedure for multi-level protection is based on five protection levels – each level has its own general and extended requirements. \n\n**Follow these guidelines to perform a multi-level maturity assessment and achieve compliance with MLPS**\n\n1. Specify the grading method and process for cybersecurity multi-level protection. Generate a systems inventory, define boundaries and grade all internal systems based on business importance, data type, and data volume, among others.\n\n2. Conduct a self-assessment to determine which of the five protection levels the systems fall into and the security control measures that need to be adhered to. For Level 2 or above, consult with a qualified external expert to conduct an additional verification. If the expert finds unfulfilled items, take remedial action by implementing technical measures, improving management policies, and so on.\n\n3. Submit grading documentation, assessment results, external expert reviews, and approval from authorities (where applicable), to an independent expert recognized by the MLPS for examination and verification. For Level 2 or above, file a record with the local Ministry of Public Security (MPS) within 10 working days of the review to obtain the filing certification. This marks the completion of the grading process.\n\n4. Ensure continuous compliance with MLPS by conducting periodic reviews of systems and applications. Level 2 networks need to be reassessed every two years, Level 3 annually, Level 4 every 6 months and Level 5 based on the time period selected by the local regulatory ministry.\n\nFor more information, refer to the [KPMG guide on MLPS 2.0] (https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/cn/pdf/en/2019/05/mlps-insights-strategies.pdf).",

These failures can be an indicator of a malicious data injection attack.\n* **Output validation** failures, such as database record set mismatch, or invalid data encoding.\n* **Backend TLS connection failures.**\n* **Authentication** successes and failures.\n* **Authorization**  successes and failures, especially for sensitive information.\n ***Permissions*** or access control changes, including updates to existing permissions.\n* **Session management** failures, such as cookie session ID value modification\n* **Application errors** and **system events**, such as syntax and runtime errors, connectivity problems, performance issues, third party service error messages, file system errors, file upload virus detection, and configuration changes.\n* **Start-up and shut-down** processes and **logging initialization** for applications and related systems, including all starting, stopping or pausing.\n* **Legal and other opt-ins**, such as permissions for mobile phone capabilities, terms of use, terms and conditions, personal data usage consent, and permission to receive marketing communications.\n* **High-risk feature** usage, including the following:\n    * Network connections.\n    * Addition or deletion of users.\n    * Changes to privileges.\n    * Assigning users to tokens.\n    * Adding or deleting tokens.\n    * Use of systems administrative privileges.\n    * Access by application administrators.\n    * All actions by users with administrative privileges.\n    * Access to payment cardholder data.\n    * Use of data encrypting keys.\n    * Key changes.\n    * Creation and deletion of system-level objects.\n    * Data import and export, including screen-based reports.\n    * Submission of user-generated content, especially file creation.\n\nLogging the following events is optional depending on your business requirements:\n\n* Sequencing failure.\n* Excessive use.\n* Data changes.\n* Fraud and other criminal activities.\n* Suspicious, unacceptable or unexpected behavior.\n* Modifications to configuration.\n* Application code file or memory changes.\n\nFor more information about logging events and attributes, see the [OWASP Logging Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Logging_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n\n__Note:__ If you log data based on user input, enforce an upper limit to the length of each log entry to make sure it is within an expected range. Otherwise, it is possible to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition by filling the target disks with log data.\n\nThe Guide to Computer Security Log Management (NIST SP 800-92) provides valuable information on how to design a suitable log and auditing system. The document describes the following types of useful logs:\n\n - Client requests and server responses.\n - Successful and failed authentication attempts, account changes and other account information.\n - Number of transactions in a certain period, or other usage information about an account.\n - Specific operational actions, such as application startup and shutdown, application failures, and major changes to application configurations.",

You will need to use `android.view.SurfaceView`, `android.view.SurfaceHolder` and `android.hardware.Camera` classes.\n2. Create a preview of what camera is receiving in the surface viewer. To display a live preview of what the camera is viewing you will need to implement a Callback for android.view.SurfaceHolder (android.view.SurfaceHolder.Callback) as preview class. \n(Callbacks are classes that contain specific methods that are called on your behalf at certain times.) \n3. In surfaceCreated() method of the Callback, get the camera instance and show what it is receiving:\n\n        myCamera = Camera.open();\n        myCamera.setPreviewDisplay(myHolder);\n\t\t\n4. Make sure that you implement surfaceDestroyed() in the Callback so that it releases the camera resources:\n\n        myCamera.stopPreview();\n        myCamera = null;\n\n5. Create a button that when clicked, takes a picture. You will need to call the method takePicture() of class Camera to take a picture. It expects an argument of type Camera.PictureCallback. It is basically what you want to do with the captured data:\n\n\t\n     \t       PictureCallback rawCallback = new PictureCallback() {\n\t\tpublic void onPictureTaken(byte[] data, Camera camera) {\n\t\t\t// DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH DATA HERE     }\n\t\t}  \n\t\t\n6. You can send the data directly to the server without having to save it on the local storage.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFor more information, refer to [Android Training on Direct Usage of Camera](http://developer.android.com/training/camera/cameradirect.html).\n",

For example, when user entry values are automatically added to a dictionary, that confidential data could be accessed without authorization.\n\nAlso, even if your app deletes a temporary sensitive file, the data is not usually physically removed from the memory. Consequently, when the device is lost or compromised, the confidential data can be leaked.\n\n- For example, temporarily storing camera image captures (e.g., banks' remote deposit capture (RDC)) on the device's secondary storage (e.g., flash memory) before handling or transmitting them.",

For example, suppose a template gets the name from the user and shows a greeting on the page along with the name as below :\n\n````\nHello {name}\n````\nTo verify if the Template is vulnerable, replace `name` with an arbitrary code like `{'5'*5}` . If the Template doesn't perform validation and executes the payload, this test __fails__ . For example, the output of `Hello {{'5'*5}}` in a vulnerable _Twig_ engine would be `Hello 25`, and in _Jinja2_ it would be `Hello 55555` . Therefore, the output can reveal the Template engine because it can be different in different Template engines. \nAfter finding the Template in use, analyze the Template documentation to find vulnerabilities in syntax, variables, methods, the execution of arbitrary remote code, and so on. \n\n_Note:_ The syntaxes and payloads you use for testing can be different and depends on the language of the template you are using.\n\n\n__Note:__ Certain automated detection tools, such as BurpSuite, can help you detect SSTI, but some blackbox security assessments are likely to miss it.",

For each TCP View list item from #4 connect to the interface \"Local Address\" and apply a monitoring filter to examine only traffic of type \"Protocol\" and targeting port \"Remote Port\". Start capturing network traffic.\n\n6. Restart the client application. Test the application again with this use case. When done, stop capturing network traffic in Wireshark.

A malicious user could exploit a separate vulnerability, such as SQL injection, to gain access to these privileges. This situation can increase the attack surface of a software environment.\n\nConsider using the following minimum restrictions:\n\n* Restrict access to tables and schemas that are needed.\n* Restrict access to actions that are needed (such as select, update, and delete).\n* Remove access to stored procedures that the application does not need.\n* Work with a database administrator to implement proper access control.",

The endpoint file may be used either for output or input:\n\n- If the file is for output, the result is that the link's endpoint file is modified, instead of the file at the intended location of the symlink. \n    -  Modifications to the endpoint file may include appending, overwriting, corrupting, changing permissions, or other modifications.\n    - An attacker may use this to forward information to a location that he has access to or do modifications or corruptions to a file at his desired location.\n- Alternatively, the endpoint file may serve as input to the targeted application.\n    - This can be used to feed malformed input into the target or to cause the target to process different information.\n    - This may allow the attacker to control the actions of the target or to cause the target to expose information to the attacker.\n\nMoreover, the actions taken on the endpoint file are undertaken with the permissions of the targeted user or application, which may exceed the permissions that the attacker would normally have.",

For example, a library is used for logging or is a web application framework. This can help to better estimate the risk of finding vulnerabilities in those components or to find other alternative libraries to replace them if needed.\n\n- Identifying the nested dependencies.\n   - The libraries that you use may have dependencies on other libraries. Use this feature to create a holistic view of all direct or transitive dependencies involved in your applications and products.\n\n- Identifying the version of the used libraries and highlighting outdated technologies.\n    - Use this feature to make sure you use the latest version of the libraries. Newer versions normally improve quality and performance, and address the known security vulnerabilities.\n    - Retire libraries that are no longer supported and replace them with the newer versions of the same library or alternative libraries.\n\n- Identifying known vulnerabilities from different sources of vulnerability intelligence like the CVE (Common Vulnerability Enumeration) list.\n    - Make sure you mitigate known vulnerabilities identified by the SCA tool. Use newer versions or alternative libraries or utilize custom security tools to avoid any exploits.\n\n- Identifying the type of licenses associated with each library.\n    - Software licenses may limit the types of usage or distribution of those libraries. They may also require specific actions if the component is modified. Use this feature to identify licenses and make sure you utilize libraries with licenses that do not conflict with your organization's objectives or policies.",

Untrusted data may cause problems not only in  HTML output but also in dynamically generated JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), or Adobe Flash components.\n\nAttackers can use this weakness to inject specially-crafted scripts into your application in order to:\n\n- Transfer private data to the attacker, such as cookies and session information.\n- Send malicious requests to a website on behalf of the victim, which is especially dangerous if the victim has administrator privileges for that site.\n- Perform phishing attacks to emulate trusted websites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that website.\n- Utilize the script to exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself, with the potential to take over a victim's machine. This is sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\" \n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim being aware of it.

This practice prevents IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) attacks.\n\nDirect object references use a direct ID such as an actual file name like `\"file=statement1.pdf\"` in the URL parameters. Alternatively, indirect object references provide a separate identifier that the application later translates into an actual ID, such as `\"file=a\"`, where `'a'` is later translated to `'statement1.pdf'`.\n\nDirect object references introduce a weakness that allows attackers to change the URL and access objects that should be off limits, such as `\"file=../config.xml\"`. An indirect object reference makes this attack impossible because the application can only provide access to a certain set of objects, such as all files in a particular directory or a predefined list of individual database records.\n\nThis control applies specifically to resources that require access control. Publicly accessible static content that is normally stored on web servers does not necessarily need this protection.\n\nIf direct object references must be facilitated, such as a filename, restrict the path to a single directory and ensure that users cannot escape out of that directory. Use a combination of allowlist validation on the filename and operating system access controls to enforce this. For example, a user should not be able to access: `\"../../sensitive_folder/sensitive.file\"`.",

Ask the design and development teams about how the application protects keys and passwords.\n\n    This test __fails__ if no controls are in place.\n\n2. Identify the data-encrypting keys used in system configuration.\n    - Verify that these keys are both encrypted and stored separate from the key-encrypting keys.\n\n    This test __fails__ if the key-encrypting keys are stored on the same storage volume as a data-encrypting key.\n\n3. Verify that access to keys is limited to the fewest possible number of users.\n    - For application vendors, check production documentation to ensure that this requirement is communicated to users.\n    - Where an application is installed, check access lists and ensure that the least number of users have access to keys.\n\n4. Verify that keys are stored securely in the fewest number of places and forms.\n\n    This test __fails__ under the following conditions:\n\n    - If a key is found to be stored in multiple files in a single system without sufficient reason.\n\n    - If a key is stored in more than one manner, such as both in the Windows registry and in a file.\n\n5. Check that the keys and passwords are not hardcoded. There are generally three ways to check if secret keys or passwords are hardcoded into the client:\n\n    1. __Decompile binary__\n        - Use a decompiler to analyze the client binaries.\n        - Look for the static strings section of the decompiled binaries.\n        - If the variable names can be decompiled, look for those that would suggest a secretive or password-type name.\n            - For instance, if the binary contains debug symbols, look for passwords within them.\n        - Otherwise, look for the content of the strings.\n            - If a string looks suspicious try to follow its usage in the decompiled code to see if it is used for signing or encrypted messages, such as an HMAC key.\n            - If these conditions are met, then the string is a strong candidate for a hardcoded secret or password.\n\n    2. __Look at static strings in binary files__\n        - Use a tool such as the Unix `strings` command that extracts static strings from binary files.\n        - This will generate a list of static strings embedded in the code.\n            - You will need to run the tool against decompressed binaries if the binaries are packaged.\n        - Then review the extracted strings manually, discard the user shown messages (such as error messages) and look for similarities to secrets or passwords.\n            - For example, look for keywords that look like a plain password, or hex digests that some systems use.\n\n    3. __Analyze the communication flow/protocols__\n        - If the protocols and messages communicated are well analyzed and understood, it is possible to derive an educated guess that the client contains a static secret or password.\n        - For example, if the client signs messages to be sent to a third party without the intervention of its server counterpart, and the third party expects a signature using the app's secret code, then it is very likely that the app's secret key for the third party service is hardcoded into the app's code.\n        - The last method would only provide clues and would not reveal or firmly prove the existence of a hardcoded secret key or password.",

You can refer to the framework/device/component documentation to help compile the list, which you should review periodically.\n \n - In addition to listing capabilities manually, use scanning tools to identify unnecessary modules, open ports, and available services, and then add those findings to the list of system components and server modules.\n \n - Configure the system and all its components to provide only necessary functionality, disabling all inessential modules, functions, services, protocols, and ports. For example, a directory listing module, HTTP or FTP protocols, or JTAG and USB ports. Disable any unnecessary ports to ensure operation with a minimum number of open ports.  \n \n - If it is feasible, limit the functionality of system components to a single function per component/device.

For example, in Windows:\n      - Righ-click My Computer, and then click Properties.\n      - Click the Advanced tab.\n      - Click the Environment Variables button.\n      - In the System Variables box, change \"Path.\"\n      - Add for example `C:\\apache-maven-3.5.2\\bin` to the list.\n\n3. Make sure you have installed JDK and have set `JAVA_PATH` the same way as above. Set `PATH` also to include a _\\bin_ folder in the Java folder.\n4. Download and unzip the CSRF project from here: [_https://github.com/aramrami/OWASP-CSRFGuard_](https://github.com/aramrami/OWASP-CSRFGuard)\n5. Run Maven (after you have unzipped the package in the CSRF3 folder):\n\n                cd \\CSRF3\\csrfguard\n                mvn clean install\n\n6. Download and install GPG from here: [_https://gpg4win.org_](https://gpg4win.org)\n7. Install Apache Tomcat 7 ([https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi)). If you use another server, you can run the test application on that server. It is assumed here that you run Tomcat 7.\n8. Run Maven for the test project:\n\n                cd \\CSRF3\\csrfguard-test\n                mvn clean package tomcat7:run\n\n9. Check the files in _\\CSRF3\\csrfguard-test\\target\\csrfguard-test-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT_.\nYou will find `web.xml` in the `\\WEB-INF` folder that specifies the folders that are protected:\n\n                <listener><listener-class>org.owasp.csrfguard.CsrfGuardServletContextListener</listener-class>\n                </listener>\n                <listener><listener-class>org.owasp.csrfguard.CsrfGuardHttpSessionListener</listener-class>\n                </listener>\n                <filter>    <filter-name>CSRFGuard</filter-name>\n                    <filter-class>org.owasp.csrfguard.CsrfGuardFilter</filter-class>\n                </filter>\n                <filter-mapping>\n                    <filter-name>CSRFGuard</filter-name>\n                    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>\n                </filter-mapping>\n                <servlet>\n                    <servlet-name>JavaScriptServlet</servlet-name>\n                    <servlet-class>org.owasp.csrfguard.servlet.JavaScriptServlet</servlet-class>\n                </servlet>\n\n10. To see the effect of the filter above, you can change the _url-pattern_ to <url-pattern>/Protected/*</url-pattern> to protect specific folders. Create such a folder (/Protected) and copy the file `protect.html` there.\n11. Find _\\csrfguard-test\\src\\main\\webapp\\Redirect.jsp_ and create a new version that redirects to _/protected/protect.html_. Save that file as _RedirectA.jsp_:\n\n          <%response.sendRedirect(\"protected/protect.html\");%>\n\n12. Stop Tomcat server and compile/start the application (csrfguard-test) again with the above changes (`mvn clean package tomcat7:run`).\n\n13. Try to access two different files: `/Protected/protect.html` and `/protect.html` using redirect jsp pages. You can see the difference (one is protected and the other one is not):\n\n                http://localhost:8000/redirect.jsp\n                http://localhost:8000/redirectA.jsp\n\n14. Return the `<url-pattern>` to `/*` and rerun the application server (`mvn clean package tomcat7:run`).\n\n15. Open `tag.jsp` file in the src folders (_csrfguard-test\\src\\main\\webapp_). Note how the CSRF tokens are added for a hyperlink:\n\n             <a href=\"http://localhost/test.html?<csrf:token uri=\"http://localhost/test.html\"/>\"> http://localhost/test.html </a>\n\n16. Hover over the links on the page to see CSRF tokens in the request (e.g. _http://localhost:8000/protect.html?OWASP-CSRFTOKEN=9VQ6-FSG8-SXIR-457E-L4A2-YQIR-QQHY-NDC7_). \n\n17. Note how the tokens are used in the forms as hidden input. You need to add a CSRF token to your forms:\n\n             <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"<csrf:tokenname/>\" value=\"<csrf:tokenvalue uri=\"protect.html\"/>\"/>\n\n18. The above steps show proof of concept for declarative protection of pages by CSRF tokens.

                "description": "Use the following guidelines for anti-CSRF tokens:\n\n- Use a library that creates anti-CSRF tokens.\n    - The code usually creates a token based on a secret parameter and a salt, then places parts of the information in cookies on the client.\n\n- Place the library-generated token in the request.\n    - For example, use the token as a hidden input in the form, or query string in a URL on the page or headers.\n\n- Use the verification function when you receive data, and check if the token is valid. \n    - The verification function verifies the token against the cookie values received with the request. \n    - Some libraries automatically perform verification for all pages and do not require calling the verification function.\n\n# About Anti-CSRF Tokens\n\nAn anti-CSRF token is a session- or transaction-specific string of random characters attached to important transactions, such as purchasing a stock on a brokerage site. In most cases, generating one CSRF token per session is enough, but the token should be independent of the session-id. When handling the client's request, the server ensures that the anti-CSRF token is the value expected for that session or transaction. If the token is not correct, then the application denies the transaction. This helps protect against CSRF because each request will have at least one unique parameter that an attacker cannot know ahead of time.\n\nFor more information about CSRF tokens, see the [OWASP CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) or [OWASP CSRF page]( https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf).",

While legitimate users need a mechanism to recover access to their accounts, these mechanisms should be properly secured.\n\nPassword recovery features can be misused by attackers, and can completely undermine secure password authentication. Design these features carefully so that they don't become a system's weakest link.\n\nWeaknesses in password reset features include the following:\n\n- Security questions are easy to guess or look up.\n- Confirmation emails include the password in clear text, or can be sent to non-user email accounts.\n- Password reset features do not have a throttling feature to prevent denial of service (DoS) attacks that can lock out a user account.\n- The original account password is sent to the user instead of a new temporary password.\n- Valid user accounts can be collected based on the system's response to entering a username into the password reset feature (user enumeration).\n- Not initializing password reset tokens with a random value, and leaving them as *NULL* in the database, can lead to unwanted password resets.",

The process helps address cybersecurity challenges based on higher levels of architectural abstraction, cybersecurity controls, existing design, and identified weaknesses within the components. Satisfy the following requirements iteratively until no additional adjustments to the cybersecurity controls are necessary:\n\n- Define cybersecurity specifications based on higher-level abstractions, controls, and existing design, while allocating cybersecurity requirements to architectural design components. \n\n    - Cybersecurity specifications involve interface relationships among sub-components in the architecture, addressing their usage and static-dynamic aspects for meeting cybersecurity requirements.\n    - Consider post-development implications, such as secure key store management, debug interface deactivation, and the deletion of personal data.\n    - Identify configuration and calibration parameters relevant to cybersecurity requirements, including their settings or allowed value ranges, like proper hardware security module integration.\n    - Evaluate component capabilities for implementing cybersecurity controls, such as processor performance and memory resources.\n\n\n- Analyze the architectural design to identify and address weaknesses. Identified weaknesses undergo analysis for potential vulnerabilities, which are subsequently addressed. Remember that incorporating known weaknesses and vulnerabilities from reused components is possible. Notably, a resolution of identified weaknesses through architectural design modifications can be achieved without conducting a vulnerability analysis.\n\n\n- Specify procedures that will ensure cybersecurity after component development. This includes secure integration and maintenance.\n\n\n- Apply well-established and trusted design and implementation principles to avoid or mitigate weaknesses.",

The view handles the autofill values that the framework sends to it and provides suggestions back to the users.\n\nIf you are building an autofill service:\n\n- Securely store user data.\n    - Avoid using shared locations and storing data in `SharedPreferences` so that data is directly accessible to other applications, such as in `MODE_WORLD_READABLE` mode.\n- Encrypt values of sensitive data fields before storing them.\n- Require authentication before providing access to sensitive and important data fields.\n\nIf you are using autofill services, such as by having any views that could be autofilled or share data with autofill services:\n\n- Avoid enabling autofill on the view if the view mainly contains sensitive data.\n- If you enable autofill, set `.setDataIsSensitive(true)` on all the nodes with sensitive data.\n    - While the value is true by default, there is a chance that you set this to false in a loop or by a similar method.\n- For more information on setting the `.setDataIsSensitive(true)` value for custom views, click [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/text/autofill.html).\n- For an example of setting the `.setDataIsSensitive(true)` value for custom views, click [here](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-AutofillFramework).

Choose and configure a dynamic application security testing (DAST) tool that is best for your environment according to the scope of testing and its importance. \n2. Where possible, integrate and automate the process into the application deployment pipeline using available plugins.\n3. Consult with your security team to determine the minimum critical level of findings that block the build.\n4. Perform a partial DAST on the deployed application after each staging release. Set boundaries of testing in the profile and limit the testing parameters so that it doesn't test the whole system if not needed.\n5. Document the results and triage the DAST findings. \n6. Communicate the findings clearly to developers, including actionable solutions or recommendations. Ensure that the findings are passed through the same bug tracking processes used in the standard CI/CD workflow.\n7. After developers fix the identified issues, reperform a partial DAST test. Repeat the find/fix process until the test passes.\n8. Run a complete DAST before rolling out to production and make sure it passes the full test. Otherwise, triage the findings and hand them over to the development team for remediation.\n9. Review the results after each partial or complete DAST test. Then, fine-tune the scanner configuration to reduce false positives, and set the scanner policies to shape the scanning boundaries properly.\n10. Include web privacy scans in the DAST configuration, and track remediation accordingly. \n\n__Notes:__\n\n- This countermeasure will not transition to 'Complete' unless its corresponding scan is completed with __zero 'High' and zero 'Critical' findings__.\n- In addition, if this countermeasure is transitioned to 'Complete', it will __reopen if a scan has not been run with its results imported into SD Elements within its predefined time threshold__.",

                "description": "Use content security policy (CSP) headers to mitigate some security risks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) for web applications.\n\n**NOTE:** Browsers that do not support CSP headers simply ignore them. **Do not merely rely on CSP headers** as the primary means of protection against XSS, and always implement proper output encoding and escaping techniques. You can find a browser compatibility table from Mozilla [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP#Browser_compatibility).\n\nConsider the following guidelines:\n\n- The main header is __`Content-Security-Policy`__. Use it as outlined here.\n- Specify the sources that you trust for loading scripts (in `script-src`).\n    - It normally includes your domain and the domain that you load scripts from: `Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' 'https://myScriptDomain.com';`.\n- __Do not include `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` among the script sources__.\n    - The first enables the use of inline JavaScript, and the second allows the use of text-to-JavaScript code evaluation functions such as `eval()`.\n\n- Specify the authorized origins for connections by setting `connect-src`:\n    - This directive restricts these methods of communication: `<a> ping`, `Fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `WebSocket`, and `EventSource`.\n    - Specify `'none'` if you are not using these connection methods.\n    - It is especially important to restrict \"ping\" in links because they can be manipulated by malicious JavaScript to steal information.\n    - Specify 'Nonce' and 'Hash' for inline or remote scripts. This works as an additional layer of defense and reduces the risk of script injection, or load of scripts from untrusted sources. For more complex webpages, managing CSPs for various external resources can become very cumbersome. [This articles expands on the use of nonces, hashes and 'strict-dynamic' to simplify this process](https://websec.be/blog/cspstrictdynamic/).\n    - See [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/connect-src) page from Mozilla for more information about `connect-src`.\n\n- Specify the target of the forms. This is crucial because malicious scripts can change the forms' action and target and steal the submitted data. See this [page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/form-action) from Mozilla for options and examples.\n    - In the most common scenarios, you just need to specify your target domain. For example:  `<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Security-Policy\" content=\"form-action 'https://*.mydomain.com'\">`\n\n- Specify the origins that frames are allowed to load content from in `frame-src`, including iFrames.\n    - If you do not use frames, specify `'none'`.\n- Other possible headers include: `font-src`, `img-src`, `media-src` (audio/video), `object-src` (mainly for Flash), and `style-src` (stylesheets).\n- __Set `default-src`, which defines the default value for all the other policies__ that are not defined in your CSP. For example, specify 'self' in the value.\n    - Not setting a policy is equivalent to setting it to the default value.\n    - If the default value is not set, the default policy will be open.\n- __Set `sandbox` value to `\"\"`, __especially for iFrames__ whenever you do not need other options such as allow-forms, allow-popups, allow-same-origin, allow-pointer-lock, allow-scripts, or allow-top-navigation.\n- __Set `report-uri` to a report page__ that you have developed to log all errors and violations that will be encountered.\n    - The browser sends reports of any violation to the address that you have specified in the form of a JSON document.\n    - The information includes document-uri, referrer, blocked-uri, violated-directive, and original-policy.\n- For more information, consult the [OWASP Content Security Policy](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Content_Security_Policy).\n\n**Notes:** \n\n- For more information about XSS prevention, see the [OWASP XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet).\n- For a [step by step guide to deploying CSP, read this article](https://websec.be/blog/cspstepbystep/).",

                        "text": "CSP headers are backward compatible. However, some browsers may not implement the headers, or different variations of them, depending on their version. Use the ***X-XSS-Protection*** HTTP response header if you are targeting older browsers that do not support CSP. This header uses the following settings:\n\n- `0`: Disables XSS protection.\n- `1`: Enables XSS protection. If XSS is detected, the browser removes unsafe characters to prevent the attack.\n- `1; mode=block`: Enables XSS protection. If XSS is detected, the browser does not show the page at all.\n\n**Notes:** \n\n- Keep in mind that Content Security Policy (CSP) provides a more powerful and secure method to protect against content injection attacks. Furthermore, X-XSS protection can possibly open doors to some vulnerabilities, as discussed [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection). Hence, use X-XSS protection only if you need to support browsers that do not support CSP. \n- If your application supports older versions of Internet Explorer, read and follow guidelines on protecting your application against the [Grave Accent Issue](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-java-encoder/wiki/Grave-Accent-Issue).\n- *X-XSS-Protection* does not block all types of XSS attacks. Consider using it in addition to other safety measures.",

                    "text": "JDK provides 'jarsigner', which is a powerful command line tool for signing and verifying the signature of JAR files. Three steps are involved in signing and verifying jar files: 1) create/obtain a keypair to sign, 2) sign a JAR file, and when necessary, 3) verify the signature of the JAR file.\n\n## 1. Generating a keypair:\n\nAnother JDK tool, 'keytool' allows you to generate a keypair for signing. Let's call this keypair `myAlias` and the keystore file, `myKeyFile`:\n\n          cd %JAVA_HOME%\\bin\n          keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias myAlias -keystore myKeyFile\n\n## 2. Signing a JAR file:\n\nRun this command to sign the JAR file. The input is `Encoder.jar`. The output will be created as `SignedEncoder.jar`. We have used the `myAlias` key pair (the private key portion of the myAlias key pair) to sign the JAR file. The tricky part is -tsa, which specifies the timestamp authority. There are many timestamp authority servers that can sign the timestamp along with the JAR file to guarantee that the time of signing is authentic. We will return to timestamp authorities later in this how-to.\n\n            jarsigner -keystore myKeyFile -signedjar SignedEncoder.jar -tsa http://tsa.safecreative.org Encoder.jar myAlias\n\n## 3. Verifying the signature\n\nThe verification step is easy because all of the necessary information is integrated into the `SignedEncoder.jar` (output) file. You simply run the following command:\n\n            jarsigner verify SignedEncoder.jar\n\n\n## Timestamp Authority\n\nUsers can validate a signature, but cannot tell when signing took place without a timestamp. You can add time information to the signature with the help of a trusted intermediary called the Timestamp Authority. Several Certificate Authorities perform timestamping as well. Timestamping involves including time data along with the hash of data in the signature. For an illustration of the timestamping process, see this [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping#/media/File:Trusted_timestamping.svg). Jarsigner gives a warning when it signs code without a timestamp.\n\n\n## More information about jarsigner and signatures\n\nWhen a signature is created, a signature file with a .SF extension and a signature block file with a .DSA extension are created. The combination of these files, along with the certificate of the signer guarantees that data has not been manipulated after the signature. You can change the name of these files. There are a lot more details about jarsigner that you can obtain to customize your signature. For an informative and elaborate description of signing JARs, see this [course from the University of Washington](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/98au/java/jdk1.2beta4/docs/tooldocs/win32/jarsigner.html). Alternatively, see the following articles from Oracle for more information about: [concepts of JAR signing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/intro.html), the [signing process](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/signing.html), and the [verification process](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/verify.html).",

Attackers can also cause a denial of service attack by feeding your application with large bulks of data.\n\nThe risk is especially higher when the downloaded data resides on shared resources that are accessible to other applications, or when they are transferred over an unsecured network. For example, files are at risk when they are stored in the shared external storage of a mobile device.\n\nUsing third-party servers, for example, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to host files such as Javascript libraries and CSS stylesheets that are shared among multiple sites can also increase the risk of the remote content being manipulated by attackers. CDNs can improve site performance and conserve bandwidth; however, using third-party hosted content comes with a risk, in that if an attacker gains control of the third-party server, the attacker can inject arbitrary malicious content into files (or replace the files completely) and thus can also potentially attack all sites that fetch files from that third-party content provider.",

Find transactions that should be accessible to a specific user only. Many applications have hundreds or thousands of such transactions. Try to select transactions that are particularly sensitive to the organization. Some examples are viewing a single user's credit card details, viewing an account balance, changing a user's shipping address, etc.  \n3. Perform one such transaction. For example, view an account balance.  \n4. In Burpsuite, search for any parameters that might be used to indicate which user the request is for. Make note of any such parameters.\n5. Attempt to perform the same transaction as in step 3. Go to proxy->intercept. Modify the parameters or cookies you noted in step 4 and press \"Forward.\" Note that you may need to do this step several times, as a single transaction may generate several HTTP requests.  \n6. View the result on the screen in your browser. If you were able to view or modify another user's data, then this test fails.  If you were not able to view or modify another user's data to at least 5 other possible values, then this test passes.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 for as many important transactions as possible.",

Refer to [Android documents](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html) for more details.\n\n- __Verify the application's certificate at runtime:__ See [Sign your app](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html) to learn how to create a certificate, and [verifying your app's signing certificate at runtime](https://www.airpair.com/android/posts/adding-tampering-detection-to-your-android-app) to learn how to check the integrity of your application at runtime.\n\n\n- __Verify the application's checksum:__ To ensure your application's integrity and ensure that it hasn't been tampered with, you can verify its checksum. Android 12 provides the `PackageManager.requestChecksums()` API, which allows developers to calculate checksums for APKs. One way to use checksums to test that your application has not been tampered with is to calculate the hash digest of the application using `PackageManager.requestChecksums()` and then send it to your backend server. If the received checksum matches the checksum of the application in your database, your application can proceed to the next step.",

In the local deadlock, the provider process may be poorly designed, leading to a deadlock. This can be detected by the application or its underlying operating system. In a distributed deadlock, on the other hand, services may be indefinitely waiting for one another to release a resource they require for carrying out a function. This can eventually lead to stalling the execution of services until it is detected by the administrator. As web services can be sequenced, the probability of circular waits increases.\n\nServices may also be initiating requests back and forth to one another to solve a problem. This can lead to infinite recursions. For example:\n\n- Suppose service *A* initiates a request to service *B* to solve a problem.\n- Service *B* then looks up the UDDI registry to dynamically bind a web service providing this function to carry out this request and finds service *A*.\n- It then forwards the request back to service *A*.\n- They keep forwarding the requests to one another until they run out of resources.\n\nThis error can render services *unavailable* even without malicious intent.",

Add relevant vulnerabilities as customized Weaknesses and Countermeasures in the tool.\n3. Create a new release project for each production release, including [Key change survey considerations](/library/glossary/G68/).\n4. Schedule regular assessments to include the impact of the software changes and new vulnerabilities.\n5. Make sure your instance of SD Elements is updated to the latest version. If applicable, implement [Open-source component controls](/library/glossary/G69/).\n6. Review the Risk Dashboard to assess changes to the scope of risk policies and determine risk criteria.\n7.

Even when detected, these failures can be difficult to fix, so an administrator could be forced to disable the product entirely.\n\nThe two main variations of hard-coded passwords are inbound and outbound:\n\n- __Inbound Variant__\n    - A default administration account is created with a simple password. This password is hard-coded into the product.\n    - This password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or patching the software. \n    - If the password is ever discovered or published, then anybody can access the product. \n    - Since all installations of the software will have the same password, even across different organizations, this allows large-scale attacks to take place, such as worms.\n\n- __Outbound Variant__\n    - This applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. \n    - The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered.\n    - A programmer may simply hard-code these back-end credentials into the front-end software. \n    - Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. \n    - Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat because extracting a password from a binary file is not difficult.",

Unlike C/C++ where you can overwrite the memory location that stores the sensitive information and explicitly free the memory allocated to an object, in Java, the system's garbage collector takes care of object deletion.\n\nAdditionally, most Android AIPs, such as `EditText` used for collecting password from user interface, return `String` or other java non-primitive objects. \n\nThe best approach is to make sure there are no references left to objects that store the sensitive data as well as to intermediate objects that might hold a copy of the said data. Afterwards, a call to system's garbage collector, `System.gc()`, will likely result in recycling of the objects. This approach will ensure that no persistent copy of the sensitive data will be left in the program.\n\nA common practice that helps avoid having references left in the program is to avoid handling sensitive data in persistent code blocks such as main loops or program or network reading loops. Instead, the data must be handled in functions called from the persistent code blocks, limiting the scope of variables referencing sensitive objects.",

However, if you can justify storing data in the browser, that data needs to be encrypted.\n\nThe mechanism for encrypting data in the browser is driven by the requirement to gain access to the data while the application is offline (i.e., a Progressive Web App). \n\n\n__When offline access is not a requirement__, follow these steps:\n\n* Authenticate the user against the backend system\n* Request a salt from the client (see notes below)\n* Use the salt to generate a symmetric encryption key\n* Send the key to the client (see notes below)\n* Use the client key to encrypt and decrypt data at rest.\n* To regain access to encrypted data, follow these steps again using the existing salt.\t \n\n\t__*Note:*__ More detail is available in the How-To section of this countermeasure (Encrypt using a key obtained from the server).\n\n__When offline access is a requirement__, follow these steps:\n\n* Generate or retrieve a salt on the client (see notes below)\n* Prompt the user for a passphrase to initialize the encryption/decryption key\n* Use the user's passphrase and salt to generate a symmetric encryption key\n\t* Passphrases can be turned into cryptographic keys using a Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF)\n\t\t* PBKDF2 is a widely supported function that achieves this.\n* Use the key to encrypt and decrypt data at rest.\n* To regain access to encrypted data, follow these steps again using the existing salt.\n\n\t__*Note:*__ More detail is available in the How-To section of this countermeasure (Encrypt using a key generated from a user passphrase).\n\t__*Note:*__ The steps here only concern access to encrypted data. User authentication against backend systems is a crucial part of a PWA running in online mode.\n\n\n__*Additional Notes*__\n\n* The key is derived using a per-client salt\n\t* Use unique keys per client. An example of a client instance is a specific browser.\n\t* Key uniqueness is guaranteed by using a per-client salt.\n\t* Randomly generate the salt by the client and store it in the browser. When an existing salt is available, it should be reused.\n\t* The salt can be stored in Local Storage in plain text\n* The key is used in the browser to encrypt and decrypt locally stored data\n\t* Keep the key in memory on the client. Do not store the key in the browser.\n\t* When the client's browsing context is closed, the key will be dismissed.\n* The implementation of the encryption/decryption logic must be centralized\n\t* In an Angular application, these features are typically implemented using an application-wide service. Only this service handles the keys.",

Establish the scope for the TRA, related to the purpose of the assessment and the risk environment.\n3. Assemble a team with the knowledge and skills needed to collect essential information, analyze the data and recommend meaningful solutions to meet the business objectives of the organization. \n4. Identify the resources required, assign responsibilities and establish a realistic schedule for TRA activities.\n5. Review vulnerability reports and statistics for previous software to inform the security risk assessment.\n6. List all assets that fall within the scope of the assessment. Determine the level of impact that might reasonably be expected to arise in the event of a compromise to the confidentiality, availability or integrity of each asset. Assign asset values and prioritize the list of assets, ranked from the most valuable to the least.\n7. List all meaningful threats/risks that might affect assets within the scope of the assessment. Assess the probability of each threat/risk actually occurring, and determine the potential impact of each threat/risk. Assign threat/risk levels for each threat/risk based on their likelihood and impact. Produce a list of threats/risks ranked from the most serious to the least.\n8. List all relevant safeguards that fall within the scope of the assessment, in detail. Determine the effectiveness of these safeguards in mitigating potential threats/risks. Identify remaining vulnerabilities that expose assets to the identified threats/risks.\n9. Assess the effects of vulnerabilities on the likelihood of each threat/risk occurrence, the probability of compromise, and the severity of ensuing damage. Assign relative levels for each vulnerability based on the increased exposure to the compromise of confidentiality, availability or integrity. Produce a list of vulnerabilities ranked from the most serious to the least.\n10. Identify realistic safeguards that would mitigate all risks identified by addressing their associated vulnerabilities, and reduce them to an acceptable level.\n11. Present the TRA report to the risk acceptance authority with the findings and recommendations of the TRA project.",

Only update from known sources after checking the software/firmware signature;\n- Securely configure third-party components, avoid using pre-configured defaults, and disable all unnecessary accounts and features. Unnecessary components include unused storage capacities, sensors, communication ports, transmitters, emailing capabilities, and messaging capabilities;\n- Create a list of all components that document the component ID, vendor, revision level, capabilities, and security risks. Update this list regularly.\n- Follow [open-source component controls](/library/glossary/G69/) for proper management of open-source components.\n- If you are integrating third-party services into your application, follow these steps:\n    - Authenticate the third-party services and use only secure channels for communication.\n    - Securely remove integrations that are no longer needed.\n\n__Notes:__\n\n- This countermeasure will not transition to 'Complete' unless its corresponding scan is completed with __zero 'High' and zero 'Critical' findings__.\n- In addition, if this countermeasure is transitioned to 'Complete', it will __reopen if a scan has not been run with its results imported into SD Elements within its predefined time threshold__.",

For instructions on how to set up Burpsuite with your browser,  see [Burp Suite Setup Guide](/library/glossary/G11/ \"Burp Suite Setup Guide\").\n3. Attempt to perform the transaction (e.g., a file download) and then trap the request in Burpsuite.    \n4. In Burpsuite, go to the proxy screen and edit any parameter which will be used in operating system interaction. For example, you may edit a parameter that may be used in a file name.  \n5. Change the parameter by adding \"%00,\" which is the URL encoding of the null character, to the beginning. Prepend this with an attack string. For file downloads, try entering in a variety of common file names. In Unix systems, you may want to try \"/etc/hosts,\" while in Windows you may want to try \"c:\\config.sys.\" If these values don't work, try adding \"../etc/hosts\" to go up one folder. If that doesn't work, try going up one more folder: \"../../hosts.\" Try going at least 10 folders up to see if you can access a sensitive file. If you are able to access a file that you should not normally have access to, then this test fails.",

It changes BIOS, firmware, master boot record (MBR), volume boot record (VBR), bootloader or any part of the system involved in the boot process and injects some malicious code that loads before the operating system (OS). Since the bootkits precede the OS and their components reside completely outside of the standard file systems, they get full control over the system and are hard to detect by typical means, such as anti-malware tools run by the operating system.\n\nPlatform integrity is also important if your application depends on the features provided by the firmware on the platform, especially security controls. An attacker may modify the firmware to circumvent some security controls. For example, on a game console, attackers can flash the firmware to remove code that checks the signatures on games installed on the platform, and can consequently run non-genuine versions of the game.",

Android Framework provides a SafetyNet Attestation API that helps you assess the APK information of your application and the security and compatibility of the Android environment your application runs in. SafetyNet API examines both software and hardware information on the device.\n\nTo use SafetyNet API, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a Google Play Services API client.\n2. Add SafetyNet API to the client.\n3. Connect to Google Play Services API.\n4. Obtain a single-use token (nonce).\n5. Request a compatibility check from SafetyNet API using the nonce.\n6. Read the compatibility check response.\n7. Verify the compatibility check response and react accordingly if the integrity of the device is not approved.\n\nFor more information about using SafetyNet API, as well as code samples, see [Android's SafetyNet documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html).",

                        "text": "In Android environment, detecting rooted devices and custom builds/ROMS is important to attest the integrity of the platform. There are many different ways of root detection on Android other than using the SafetyNet API. It is important to use as many of these methods as possible to reduce the risk of application modding.\n\n# Checking existing files\nOne of the very common methods for root detection is checking the filesystem for the existence of files that are typically found on rooted devices.\n\nCheck for app packages of common rooting tools such as Superuser:\n\n```\n/system/app/Superuser.apk\n```\n\nAlso, check for binaries that are usually installed once a device is rooted. For example, check for `su` binary at different locations. `su` is usually found in the following locations:\n\n```\n/sbin/su\n/system/bin/su\n/system/xbin/su\n/system/xbin/busybox\n/data/local/su\n/data/local/xbin/su\n```\n\n# Executing `su`\nExecute `su` using `Runtime.getRuntime.exec()`. This will throw an `IOException` if `su` is not in `PATH`. Also, try to execute other tools that are typically found on rooted devices like `busybox`.\n\n# Checking running processes\n`su` on Android depends on a background process called `daemonsu`. Check for the presence of this process. Its existence is a sign of a rooted device.\n\nRunning processes can be enumerated through:\n\n- `ActivityManager.getRunningAppProcesses()` API, or\n- the `ps` command, or\n- walking through the `/proc` directory\n\n#Checking installed app packages\nCheck for the existence of application packages that are normally found on rooted devices like:\n\n```\ncom.thirdparty.superuser\neu.chainfire.supersu\ncom.noshufou.android.su\ncom.koushikdutta.superuser\ncom.zachspong.temprootremovejb\ncom.ramdroid.appquarantine\n```\n\nThe Android package manager can be used to obtain a list of installed packages.\n\n# Checking for writable partitions and system directories\nIn a normal Android environment, system and data directories are usually mounted as read-only. However, on a rooted device, you sometimes find them mounted with read-write permission.\n\nCheck for the permissions of system directories by trying to create a file in them.\n\n# Checking `BUILD.TAGS`\nOne method for checking if the firmware is built customarily is to check for the existence of `test-keys` under `BUILD.TAGS`. If it exists, it is an indication of a custom Android image. Stock Android ROMs from Google are normally built with `release-keys` tag.\n\n# Checking for OTA certificates\nStock Android builds normally use Google Over-The-Air (OTA) certificates for updating Android. Missing OTA certificates usually means that there is a custom ROM installed which is updated through other means. Check for the existence of:\n\n```\n/etc/security/otacerts.zip\n```\n\nReference: [OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Mobile_Security_Testing_Guide)\n",

It changes BIOS, firmware, master boot record (MBR), volume boot record (VBR), bootloader or any part of the system involved in the boot process and injects some malicious code that loads before the operating system (OS). Since the bootkits precede the OS and their components reside completely outside of the standard file systems, they get full control over the system and are hard to detect by typical means, such as anti-malware tools run by the operating system.\n\nPlatform integrity is also important if your application depends on the features provided by the firmware on the platform, especially security controls. An attacker may modify the firmware to circumvent some security controls. For example, on a game console, attackers can flash the firmware to remove code that checks the signatures on games installed on the platform, and can consequently run non-genuine versions of the game.",

                "description": "The following provides guidance on how to avoid, restrict, and reduce the risk of 'remember me' functionality:\n\n- Avoid 'remember me' features for applications with critical functionality. For example, a banking application's login page does not need to provide a 'remember me' feature. The login page can still remember some public data, such as the account number of the user, but should not automatically log the user in if the session is terminated. For example, a user should not be able to automatically log in to a banking web site after the browser is closed.\n    - __Note:__ 'Remember me' is a feature that allows applications to keep their users logged in for a period of time that extends past their live session, such as after they close the browser. This type of 'remember me' functionality differs from browser features that save usernames and passwords, or web applications that save partial information, such as account numbers and client preferences.\n\n- For non-critical applications, if 'remember me' features provide a better user experience, restrict them to the normal pages of the application. Additionally, require re-authentication if a user wants to perform critical actions, such as performing a transaction, changing profile content, changing passwords, or accessing personal data.\n\n- In many cases, 'remember me' features are handled by the framework. Check the framework's documentation and set the login token expiry time to a reasonable duration. For example, set the expiry for login cookies to 8 hours.\n       - __Make session management cookies non-persistent.__ In other words, do not set 'expires' attribute on the cookies. These non-persistent cookies will only last as long as the browser session does. When the cookie does not specify an expiry date, the cookie is removed as soon as the user quits his or her browser.\n\n- If you need to implement a 'remember me' feature, use a secure method and follow implementation guidelines such as those found in these resources:\n    - The example from the section called _\"Remember Me\" - Long-Term Persistent Authentication_ in this [article](https://paragonie.com/blog/2015/04/secure-authentication-php-with-long-term-persistence)\n    - The [LoginPersist](https://github.com/craigrodway/LoginPersist) GitHub project\n    - The [rememberme](https://github.com/gbirke/rememberme) GitHub project\n\n__Notes:__\n\nSession management for web applications is usually enabled using URL entries or cookies. Cookies are a better means to manage sessions. There are two types of cookies: temporary session cookies that are removed by the browser after closing, and persistent cookies that are stored on the client for a fixed duration of time specified when the cookie is created. \n\nAn application implements 'remember me' by utilizing those persistent cookies and setting them with a considerable lifetime. The risk here is that those cookies can be stolen using various methods, either locally or on the network. You can reduce the risks by restricting the use of those cookies, validating their consistency, and making sure they are continuously renewed.",

The same question is raised when the certificates, keys or secrets are stored in a __secure key storage__. The key storage (keystore or keychain) needs a master password to allow access to its content.\n\n This master-password should either be stored on a server (received only after proper authentication), or be derived from a user-provided password (e.g. using password based key derivation functions 2 (PBKDF2)). \n\n In the second case (PBKDF2), the result will be a key that could be used as the encryption key or master-password of keystore and will depend on a user-provided password and a salt (random) value. \n\n Developers should store salt on the private storage of the application (private data folders of the application) and recalculate the key when accessing the keystore, using the password and the salt. Salt does not need any extra protection. Note that the keystore master-password in this case will be dependent on user password and this should be considered when any password change is attempted.\n",

For example, to encrypt or decrypt a file, each of these can simply wrap the resulting stream obtained by the appropriate file input/output utilities. This wrapping can be performed in the same `try` block of the stream, that is `AutoCloseable`.\n\nCipher streams can transparently encrypt/decrypt data. For example your application can read or write a normal stream without knowing about the underlying cryptography. This can be most helpful when adding encryption to an existing application, as it would not require changes beyond wrapping the stream.\n\nThe way that we can wrap a stream is to take the normal stream and initiate the encryption cipher. Then we wrap the stream using the `CipherOutputStream` around the original stream. Then we write into the newly wrapped stream.\n\nObtain your Input/OutputStream as normal (Here `out` is a normal object, of the class type `OutputStream`). Initiate a cipher:\n\n    final Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"RSA\");\n    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);\n\nWrap your stream:\n\n    OutputStream wrapped = new CipherOutputStream(out, cipher);\n\nContinue working with the wrapped stream. `CipherInputStream` works exactly the same way and its constructor `CipherInputStream(InputStream is, Cipher c)` gets `InputStream` objects along with a `Cipher` object.",

Application's secrets such as keys, proprietary data and other information that belongs to you (usually shared among all instances of the application)\n    2. User-specific sensitive data\n\n- Encrypt all these sensitive data before writing them into files on storage. Never use shared storage for storing unencrypted sensitive data that you don't want to be accessible by other processes.\n    - You can implement wrappers for data storage and retrieval functions in order to make the encryption and decryption transparent. The major benefit of these wrappers is their ability to transparently encrypt/decrypt data. For example, your application can read or write a normal stream without knowing about the underlying cryptography. This can be most helpful when adding encryption into an existing application, as it would not require changes beyond wrapping the stream functions.\n\n- Encrypt these sensitive data before writing storing them in the local databases.\n    - For mobile devices, these platform databases could be accessible on rooted or jail-broken ROMs. Therefore your application's secrets may be accessed by a hacker that owns the device.\n\n- Use a secure key storage mechanism (such as keystores or keychains) for storing keys, certificates, and/or passwords.\n\nExamples of applications that need to store sensitive information are a browser that saves user passwords locally, or an offline password management solution.",

Utilize a dedicated backup management software to strengthen the security of information backed up.\n3. Ensure that backups include operating systems, database server software, files, virtual machines, and password repositories. \n4. Record backups in a log that includes details about the data backed up, date and time of the backup, the virtual location or the backup media used and its physical location.\n5. Clearly and accurately identify backed up data as such.\n6. Protect backups from accidental overwriting, and subject them to the same level of protection as 'production' information. Additionally, consider implementing [key backup data protection controls](/library/glossary/G101/). \n7. Plan for backups plans considering legal, regulatory and contractual requirements such as the handling of [personally Identifiable Information (PII)](/library/glossary/G8/), document retention schedules and customer information.\n8. Review the backup plans to ensure that data is restored within a critical timescale beyond which a loss of service would be unacceptable to the organization. Backups must be kept as long as required by regulatory needs, a retention schedule, or service-level agreement (SLA) requirements. Remove backups that have expired their retention date from storage. \n9. For incremental backups, only back up data whose archive bit is 1 (changed).\n10. When planning database backups, consider doing logical backups for most databases. For Oracle backups use exp or Data Pump, and for Microsoft SQL Server use the Import and Export Wizard or SQL Server Integration Services utility.\n11. Verify backups to ensure that backed up software and information can be restored successfully. Document and follow [backup restoration best practices](/library/glossary/G102/).\n\nTo learn more about the types of backups and their differences, see [Backup Types](/library/glossary/G61/).\nTo familiarize yourself with the different techniques of performing backups, see [Backup Techniques](/library/glossary/G62/).",

Define audit log categories and configure the audit policies accordingly.\n2. Centralize the logs using automatic consolidation. Centralization and consolidation require technical configuration for synchronizing system clocks.\n3. Keep the logs in two formats: flat text file and log database file. Flat text files are easily compressible and ideal for archiving.\n4. Configure policies to set up real-time alerts and notifications for monitoring, such as Windows event logs for Windows systems and Syslogs for Nix systems.\n5. Adopt a methodology for continuous log monitoring by defining the frequency with which you want to check logs. Once a log is found with a suspicious pattern, an alert or notification must be issued.\n6. Generate reports for [key stakeholders](/library/glossary/G64/).\n7. Restrict the access to logs based on the [need-to-know principle](/library/glossary/G95/).\n8. Retain log files for a responsible amount of time (decide how long to keep log files based on business needs and regulation compliance).",

                    "text": "## Description\n\nAvoid hard-coding passwords and secret keys in client code or in any other file accessible on the client in an unencrypted form. Either encrypt the secrets on the client (and follow other guidelines expanded on in another task for storing sensitive data on client and in keystores), or use server side component of the application to store the secrets.\n\nWhen choosing the second option, store these keys on the server side module of your application and add a step to any process that needs to use these keys to send the request to server-side for signing, encryption, validation, or decryption via the secret key. In the following, we analyze the most common scenario:\n\nThere are certain cases such as third party services using OAuth or Single Sign On (SSO) services that the mobile app needs to sign and validate messages for communicating with a third party application. In such a case, each client application has a secret key that is used to sign the requests coming from the application. The workaround to avoid hardcoding this secret in the client side is to move the signing code along with the signature to the server side service.\n\nIn the above scenario, client applications send the request to be signed for a third party to the server. The server then validates the session on the client and signs the arguments/token and returns the signature to the client. The client will then send the received signature along with the original arguments to the third party service to establish authenticity.\n\n## Code\n\nThe following sample code shows how to sign parameters without hardcoding the secret key on the client code. The signature is displayed at the end for demonstration purposes.\n\n -- src/com/example/androidssl/AndroidSecretKey.java\n\n            public void onClick(View v) {\n                try {\n                    tView.setText(\"\");\n\n                    /* Here we will send the data that needs to be signed by a secret key\n                     * to the server. This will prevent the need to have the secret key\n                     * stored in the client code.\n                     */\n\n                    // Create a new HttpClient and Post Header\n                    HttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();\n                    HttpPost httppost = new HttpPost(eText.getText().toString());\n\n                    // Adding HTTP Post parameters\n                    List<NameValuePair> nameValuePairs = new ArrayList<NameValuePair>(2);\n                    nameValuePairs.add(new BasicNameValuePair(\"session_id\", SAMPLE_SESSION_ID));\n                    nameValuePairs.add(new BasicNameValuePair(\"query_to_sign\", \"SDEelementsSampleData\"));\n                    httppost.setEntity(new UrlEncodedFormEntity(nameValuePairs));\n\n                    // Execute HTTP Post Request\n                    HttpResponse response = httpclient.execute(httppost);\n                    HttpEntity response_entity = response.getEntity();\n                    // Get the response\n                    BufferedReader rd = new BufferedReader(new\n                        InputStreamReader(response_entity.getContent()));\n                    // And display the signature\n                    String line = \"\";\n                    while ((line = rd.readLine()) != null) {\n                        Message lmsg;\n                        lmsg = new Message();\n                        lmsg.obj = line;\n                        lmsg.what = 0;\n                        AndroidSecretKeyActivity.this.h.sendMessage(lmsg);\n                    }\n                }\n                catch (Exception e) {\n                    Message lmsg = new Message();\n                    lmsg.obj = Log.getStackTraceString(e);\n                    lmsg.what = 0;\n                    AndroidSecretKeyActivity.this.h.sendMessage(lmsg);\n                }\n            }\n\n[Download the Complete Code Example](https://preview.sdelements.com/static/code/Android/AndroidSecretKey.zip)\n\nA stand-alone demo web server is also provided to facilitate the demo test of the above application.\n\nThe server component requires python 2.4 or above.

                    "title": "Java or Android Keystore",
                    "text": "- Java provides a KeyStore class (in 'java.security' package) that could be used to store application secrets on the client.\n\n - Android provides an OS-level-managed [KeyChain](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/KeyChain.html). Alternatively, developers can use Android Keystores (Java Keystore). See this section on [choosing between Keystore and KeyChain](http://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html#WhichShouldIUse)\n\n - This code sample demonstrates how a certificate and a private key can be retrieved from a keystore.\n\n````\n  String keyStoreName = \"MyKeyStore.ks\";\n  String myKeystorePassword=\"TEST\";\n  char[] pw = myKeystorePassword.toCharArray();\n  FileInputStream f = new FileInputStream(keyStoreName);\n  // You can also use PKCS12 keystores which are compatible with platforms\n  // other than Java (if that's a concern).\n  KeyStore keystore = KeyStore.getInstance(\"JKS\");\n  keystore.load(f, pw);\n  // Certificate\n  Certificate cert = keystore.getCertificate(\"certificateAlias\");\n  // Private key\n  KeyStore.ProtectionParameter protParam =\n  new KeyStore.PasswordProtection(pw);\n  KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry pkE = (KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry) keystore.getEntry(\"PKAlias\", protParam);\n  PrivateKey pk = pkE.getPrivateKey();\n````\n - JDK9 [defaults the keystore type to the PKCS12 format](https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/jdk9-keytool-transitions-default-keystore-to-pkcs12). You can specify \"PCKS12\" instead of \"JKS\" in the code above (`KeyStore keystore = KeyStore.getInstance(\"PKCS12\");`).\n\n - Since accessing the data stored in the keystore requires the use of a master-password, the application should store the master-password (of the local keystore) somewhere. This master-password should either be stored on the server (received only after proper authentication), or be derived from a user-provided password (e.g. using Password-Based Key Derivation Functions 2 (PBKDF2)).\n\n - In the case of PBKDF2, the result will be a key that could be used as the master-key of keystore and will depend on a user-provided password and a salt (random) value. You should store the salt on the private storage of the application (private data folders of the application) and recalculate the key when accessing the keystore using the password and the salt. The salt does not need any extra protection. Be aware that the keystore master-password in this case will be dependent on a user password, which should be considered when any password change is attempted. The following piece of code shows how `inputPassword` and `salt` could be turned into a SecretKey (sk) for keystore.\n\n````\n  char[] inputPassword={...};\n  byte[] salt={...};\n  SecretKeyFactory skf = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(\"PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512\");\n  int iterations=1000;int keyLen=256;\n  KeySpec params = new PBEKeySpec(inputPassword, salt, iterations, keyLen);\n  SecretKey sk = skf.generateSecret(params);\n````\n\n - You can convert the SecretKey to String and use it as keystore password ([Base64 in Android](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Base64.html)):\n\n````\n  String stringSecretKey = Base64.encodeToString(sk.getEncoded(), Base64.DEFAULT)\n\n  Similarly, in Java:\n\n  String stringSecretKey = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(sk.getEncoded());\n````\n\n See this article for guidelines on various uses of the [Android Keystore System](http://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html).",

Although it is discouraged to save sensitive data on client, in some cases, developers need to store keys, certificates and sensitive data on mobile or client devices (for example a mobile browser needs to store user passwords). In other cases the developers need to securely store such data on the server.\n\n  __In those cases, sensitive data should be encrypted.__\n\n\n Password Zero Conundrum\n An immediate question is \"Where should developers store the master-key that is used for encryption?\" The same question is raised when the certificates, keys, or secrets are stored in a __secure key storage__. The key storage (keystore or keychain) needs a master password to allow access to its content. This is a common challenge and coined the \"password zero\" or \"secure introduction\" problem in the industry.\n\n Different solutions to the password zero problem are available, but a popular technique in cloud computing is that an identity is configured by a trusted system and included with the new service during deployment. Upon initialization of the new service, the identity is presented to the security system and an API token is received. The token is used by the new service to authenticate to other system components. Security tokens are often ephemeral making the window of opportunity narrow for attackers if the token is disclosed or exfiltrated. If the identify of the system is compromised then all tokens being issued are suspended until an investigation determines the leakage vector and its secured. HashiCorp offers a product called Vault that solves a lot of problems in this space, https://www.vaultproject.io/.\n\n In the open source GitHub CI/CD world, keystore passwords are maintained in Travis and known only to Administrators. Scripts that are run during deployment reference these passwords via shell variables that are assigned at runtime by Travis (the trusted system). The segregation provides script designers and developers access to the stored secrets, without necessarily providing direct access to the secrets. Secrets are leveraged as necessary during build and operational processes by CI environment variables. The specifics of the solution to the password zero problem depends on the design of the system and components that collaborate in the solution. It's a difficult problem to solve in a platform independent way and likely the reason it's not addressed directly by many platform designers. For instance, JKS and PKCS#12 keystores are strong, but a password is required to open them and care and handling of these passwords is often ignored by designers.\n\n Storing Salts\n Developers should store salts on the private storage of the application (private data folders of the application) and recalculate the key when accessing the keystore, using the password and the salt. Salts do not require additional protections. Note that the keystore master-password in this case will be dependent on user password and this should be considered when any password change is attempted.",

These keys must also be stored separately from their key-encrypting key.\n\nThe following locations are recommended for storing a key-encrypting key:\n\n1. On a removable drive\n2. On a different system, where access to the key is controlled using secured authentication, authorized mechanisms and transmitted securely (such as with TLS)\n\nAll hardcoded passwords or secret keys can be retrieved from a client. Unless a secure key management system is used, a skilled attacker can bypass simple client-side techniques to obfuscate key/passwords. Avoid storing hardcoded secret keys or passwords on a client at all times.\n\nWhen you need to store an application secret:\n\n- Where possible, use alternative APIs that do not need that secret.\n    - For instance, use the user's Facebook session.\n\n- When an alternative method is not available, store the secret on a server and proxy the requests through it.\n    - The server needs to perform all the required validations, including the whitelisting of actions that are allowed, and validating that a registered user is logged into the app on the mobile device (validating the session).\n\n- Use a secure keystore / keychain with a master password that is derived from a salt and a password that is entered by the user or retrieved from a safe location as described in the How-to for this countermeasure.\n\n__Note__: The key-encrypting key must be at least as strong as the data-encrypting key that it secures.",

Identify the page that you want to test for SSI directives injection.\n    - The page must take user input in the form of cookie content, text input field, query string, or HTTP headers and respond accordingly.\n\n2. Create an SSI directive in the form of `<!--#directive parameter=value parameter=value -->`.\n    - For example: \n        `<!--#include virtual=\"/link/to/myfile.txt\" -->` includes the content of `myfile.txt` in a served HTML file.\n\n3. Put `myfile.txt` on a location that is accessible by your server. Get a link or path to the file.\n4. Navigate to the pages that you identified in step 1.\n5. Choose a set of parameters or input fields to test.\n6. For each parameter or input field from step 5, submit the crafted SSI directive from step 2.\n\nThis test __fails__ if the page renders content from `myfile.txt` in step 2.\n\nTry other SSI directives that are supported by your server. For instance, if `#exec` or `#echo` are supported, test if they are adequately neutralized.",

Make sure to use a synced time source.\n- **Enforce an upper limit** to the length of each log entry to make sure it is within an expected range if you log data based on user input.\n    - Otherwise, it is possible to cause a denial of service condition by filling the target disks with log data.\n- Consider the **types of auditing and audit processing requirements** before allocating audit record storage capacity.\n    - This reduces the likelihood of exceeding capacity and the potential loss or reduction of auditing capability.\n\n__Note:__ NIST SP 800-92 (the Guide to Computer Security Log Management) provides valuable information on how to design a suitable log and auditing system.",

An attacker forces a user into a **session with a known ID**:\n    - Once the user is authenticated, the attacker has access to the authenticated session. \n3. The application or container uses **predictable session IDs**: \n    - If an attacker can determine the ID of a session, they can create a new session with a known session ID.\n    - The attacker can then use this compromised session to force a user into logging into the application.\n    - Once the user is authenticated into the compromised session, the attacker can use application's account with all of the privileges of the user.\n    - This is called **session hijacking**.",

Untrusted data may cause problems not only in  HTML output but also in dynamically generated JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), or Adobe Flash components.\n\nAttackers can use this weakness to inject specially-crafted scripts into your application in order to:\n\n- Transfer private data to the attacker, such as cookies and session information.\n- Send malicious requests to a website on behalf of the victim, which is especially dangerous if the victim has administrator privileges for that site.\n- Perform phishing attacks to emulate trusted websites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that website.\n- Utilize the script to exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself, with the potential to take over a victim's machine. This is sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\" \n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim being aware of it.

                    "text": "There are a few instructions to follow when performing Java object serialization:\n\n 1. Do not put confidential data in plain text in serialized data.\n 2. Do not de-serialize untrusted data.\n 3. Check the integrity and authenticity of serialized objects before attempting to de-serialize them.\n 4. Do not use unsafe Java libraries that are provided with untrusted data. There are so many of such libraries and it is best to avoid de-serializing any untrusted data from untrusted inputs altogether.\n 5. Limit the size of input data that is going to be de-serialized to avoid placing a high load on the application and causing denial of service.\n\n Note(s): The following site provides many resources for developers around the serialization problem,\n https://github.com/GrrrDog/Java-Deserialization-Cheat-Sheet\n\n Know that code in the de-serialized object e.g. `readObject()` method if implemented runs even before you cast and take control of the object. For example consider this class that needs to be serialized:\n\n````\n  import java.io.*;\n  public class Person implements Serializable {\n  public String name;\n  public int birthYear;\n  transient public int idNumber;\n  Person() {\n  System.out.println(\"In Person's Constructor.\");\n  }\n  private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {\n  System.out.println(\"Implements readObject().\");\n  in.defaultReadObject();\n  }\n  void runMe() {\n  System.out.println(\"Run Me!\");\n  }\n  }\n````\n The object can perform malicious activities in `readObject()` if you simply do this (if the data in the _fileName_ is malicious or altered):\n\n````  \n// Simple serialization that is vulnerable to code injection if used with untrusted input streams\n  //...\n  public static Object deserialize(String fileName) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {\n  FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(fileName);\n  ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fis);\n  Object obj = ois.readObject();\n  System.out.println(\"After object is read\");\n  ois.close();\n  return obj;\n  }\n  //...\n  Person newPerson = null;\n  try {\n  newPerson = (Person) deserialize(fileName);\n  } catch (ClassNotFoundException | IOException e) {\n  e.printStackTrace();\n  }\n````\n Instead this implementation, checks the size of the object, seals the object (encrypts/decrypts the data in the object), and signs it (signs the object and verifies the signature at the time of de-serialization):\n\n````\n  import java.io.*;\n  import java.security.*;\n  import javax.crypto.*;\n  import javax.crypto.spec.*;\n\n  public class Serialization {\n  static PublicKey myPubKey; // This will be generated later\n  // This key should be stored and handled securely.

For doing this it should first calculate the hash of the received data `H'`. Then:\n\n- For authenticating the server using the digital signature we have two cases:\n    - If a shared secret key `S` is used by the server for encrypting the hash `H`, then the same shared secret key should have been integrated into the client as well. If the client can decrypt the signature `SIG` using its own shared secret key `S` and get the same value as `H'` (i.e. `H = H'`), then it can be assured that the sender has the same key `S` and is trusted.\n    - If the server has used its own private key `Pr` for signing the hash `H`, then it should also send a public key certificate `C` from a trusted _Certificate Authority (CA)_ to the client. The client should first check the server's certificate `C` to make sure the public key `Pu`  embedded in the certificate `C` belongs to the expected server and is legitimate. For details about certificate validation, refer to [T156](/library/tasks/T156). Then the client should use the public key `Pu` provided in the certificate `C` to decrypt the signature `SIG`. If the decryption works fine and the result value is the same as `H'` (i.e. `H = H'`), then the client would be assured that the server has access to the corresponding private key `Pr` and is trusted.\n\n- For verifying the integrity of the data `D` using the digital signature, in both cases, the client should calculate the hash `H'` of the data `D` and compare it with the decrypted hash `H` provided by the server as mentioned above. If both hashes are the same (i.e. `H = H'`), then the client can also be assured that the data `D` is legitimate and no one has tampered with it.",

For each identified area, implement corresponding mitigating techniques and best practices to prevent a race condition.\n3. Review for possible deadlocks and follow best practices to avoid them.\n\nThe following are best practices to avoid race conditions within your application:\n\n- __Avoid using global variables__ unless absolutely necessary.\n    - You can eliminate the need for some global variables by passing them explicitly among functions.\n\n- __Use immutable (final) global variables__ if you absolutely cannot avoid them altogether.\n\n- __Avoid storing data in singleton classes/objects__ unless necessary.\n\n- __Review all the places where global variables and singleton objects are accessed__, and determine if there is a possibility that different threads pass through the same code.\n    - For example, determine if threads other than the main thread pass through the same code.\n    - If so, the singleton objects need to be __thread safe__.\n\n- __Make objects thread safe__ by wrapping access code inside a lock.\n\n- __Use error and exception handlers__ to make sure all paths from a locked function release the lock to avoid deadlocks.\n\n- Use the framework's recommended thread safe objects as __core data structures__.\n    - For example, many frameworks provide a thread safe queue or list object.\n    - Their basic operations are done in an atomic way, such as add/remove/pop.\n\n- Be careful __not to break the thread-safe property__ of a primitive or base object when customizing using inheritance.\n\n- __Review and understand how threads of operations__ are handled by your development environment. \n    - This might depend on deployment configurations as well.\n    - Adhere to all recommendations regarding thread safety.\n\n- When working with a file, __check if it is free__ before opening it.",

Make sure that your software distribution method provides a chain of trust (such as through use of a TLS connection that provides compliant cipher-suite implementations), where the integrity method implemented is not cryptographically secure (such as through the use of digital signatures).\n4. Use cryptographic functions to protect software code, especially proprietary code, files, and business logic.\n5. Keep software releases consistent and ensure that older versions cannot replace a new version, treating them as separate entities.\n6. Use version identifiers to distinguish different variants of software components to make sure that users download, and use the correct version.\n7. Provide patch information for each update of a component, including bug-fix information and component versions. \n8. Change or withdraw components from a release in a controlled manner: removing a component should only be possible if there is no dependency from another component. Alternatively, change the scope of the release for that particular component by removing it from one or more release groups.\n9. Use update mechanisms that cover all software, configuration files, and other metadata that may be used by the software for security purposes, or which may in some way affect security.\n10.

Acquire or subscribe to software from approved suppliers by implementing [vendor controls](/library/glossary/G78/).\n4. Ensure that all acquired software is supported by maintenance arrangements.\n5. Obtain the adequate number and type of licenses for planned use, and keep proof of ownership of software. \n6. Test all acquired software extensively before distribution, deployment and use. Identify security deficiencies by detailed inspection, malware testing, vulnerability scanning, reference to published sources, or by participating in user/discussion groups. If possible perform penetration and vulnerability tests to help identify and resolve security weaknesses. \n7. Mitigate the risk of security weaknesses in acquired software by requesting and obtaining external [attestations from trusted sources](/library/glossary/G107/).\n8.

This error is fixed.\n\n__Note__: To get the hardware ID of other devices around you through Bluetooth and Wifi, you need `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` or `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` permissions in Android Marshmallow and later.

Document a software vulnerability management process explaining the approach used to test applications, with an assigned owner responsible for its completeness, currency, and ongoing execution. Explain the method(s) used to identify vulnerabilities (e.g., code reviews, software testing, penetration testing, quality control) as well as software re-testing and publication.\n3. Perform vulnerability testing using automated scanning software or a commercial vulnerability scanning service. Testing should be run regularly based on a combination of code reviews, dynamic and static analysis tests.\n4. Ensure that only a limited number of authorized individuals can execute vulnerability scans, and that tests are monitored to identify misuse and help detect unauthorized testing.\n5. Set priorities and timelines for remediating all significant vulnerabilities based on their [criticality of software vulnerabilities](/library/glossary/G72/).\n6. Select one or more support tools to assist with the software vulnerability management process. \n7 .Establish and follow a [software vulnerability remediation process](/library/glossary/G71/) to ensure that vulnerabilities are fixed in a consistent manner.\n8.

This will prevent other applications from capturing and recording the Activity's screen content and also prevents taking a screenshot of the Activity.\n\n    If the application goes to the background (and in the recent app list), a blank image is shown instead of the actual screen. \n\n- Override `onActivityStopped` lifecycle method of the app to detect entering background-state and cleanse memory content. Override `onActivityStarted` method to reinitialize the cleansed variables.\n\n  __Note:__ From Android Lollipop (5), a third-party application can request capturing and recording screen content. When users provide consent, this feature will be enabled without requiring any specific permissions. If the users are not aware of the consequences, they may agree with screen capturing, and a malicious process can record the content of the screen and send it over the network.",

These reports can contain sensitive information, which should not be disclosed to unauthorized parties.\n\nExamples of sensitive data are:\n\n* Confidential or private hostnames\n* Unique path variables in the URL (e.g., a unique URL giving access to a resource)\n* Private content partnership relations between different companies",

                "description": "To analyze if your application is vulnerable to CSRF, follow these steps:\n\n1. Does your application perform state-changing operations on the backend (e.g., login, store data)?\n    * __*Yes*__: Continue with the next step\n    * __*No*__: Your application does not need protection against CSRF attacks.\n2. Does your application rely on authentication or session management mechanism that is automatically handled by the browser (e.g., cookies, HTTP Basic authentication)?\n    *  __*Yes*__: You need protection against CSRF attacks\n    *  __*No*__: Your application does not need protection against CSRF attacks.\n\n\nTo select the proper CSRF defense, follow these steps:\n\n1. Does your application generate dynamic pages on the server (e.g., PHP, JSP)?\n    * __*Yes*__: Continue with step 2\n    * __*No*__: Continue with step 3\n2. Does your application handle a small number of concurrent users (< 1000)?\n    * __*Yes*__: Use a *Synchronizer Token* pattern, as described in [Countermeasure 29](/library/tasks/T29/) and continue with step 5.\n    * __*No*__: Continue with step 3\n3. Does your application accept requests that can be sent from an HTML element (e.g., a form), or without a CORS preflight request?\n    * __*Yes*__: Continue with step 4\n    * __*No*__: Use a *secure CORS policy*, as described in [Countermeasure 257](/library/tasks/T257/).\n4. Are your application's frontend and backend deployed on the same origin?\n    * __*Yes*__: Use a *Double Submit Cookie*, as described in [Countermeasure 29](/library/tasks/T29/) and continue with step 5.\n    * __*No*__: Use a *secure CORS policy*, as described in [Countermeasure 257](/library/tasks/T257/).\n5. Does your backend only need to accept requests coming from the same domain (e.g., from `www.example.com` to `api.example.com` falls within `example.com`)?\n    * __*Yes*__: Consider using the *SameSite* cookie attribute, as described in [Countermeasure 557](/library/tasks/T557/).\n    * __*No*__: No additional security measures need to be taken.\n\nFor every application, you need to analyze if weaknesses that introduce Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) exist or not. When it is, you need to select one of four currently available defense strategies. This guideline guides you through the process and refers to other guidelines containing more details about implementing defenses.\n\n![CSRF Flowchart](https://preview.sdelements.com/static/screenshots/CSRF_defense_flowchart_v2.png)",

For example:\n\n- Create an account for the sole purpose of running a particular background process.\n    - Run Server/daemon processes under restricted user accounts.\n\n- Use accounts with access restricted to the required features and resources of a service.\n    - The code interacts with a service, such as a database, that supports user accounts and access controls.\n    - Multiple accounts may be required to use different parts of the code, and to work with different sets of data.",

For example, when user entry values are automatically added to a dictionary, that confidential data could be accessed without authorization.\n\nAlso, even if your app deletes a temporary sensitive file, the data is not usually physically removed from the memory. Consequently, when the device is lost or compromised, the confidential data can be leaked.\n\n- For example, temporarily storing camera image captures (e.g., banks' remote deposit capture (RDC)) on the device's secondary storage (e.g., flash memory) before handling or transmitting them.",

Review all statically embedded URLs in the application.\n\n2. For each `http://` URL, verify that no user data is being sent or received via the specified URL. A commonly allowed exception where non-SSL usage is permitted is the retrieval of static content, such as images and other media.\n\n3. Review all network socket creations. If SSL is not enabled on the socket, verify that no user data is being sent or received through the network endpoints.\n\n**Note**: Static code analysis might not be able to conclusively validate this test. In some cases, the protocol being used is retrieved from messages received by the client instead of being explicitly specified in the code (HTTP vs HTTPS). By reviewing the code, we may not be able to figure out whether the HTTP or HTTPS protocol is used.\n\n\n## Black-box testing\n\nUse the following guidelines for black-box testing:\n\n1. Set up a proxy or network traffic sniffing tool.\n    - The proxy or traffic sniffing tools being used must be capable of inspecting the non-SSL content.\n\n2. If a proxy is being used, make sure that the SSL traffic is not modified when passing through it (do not enable SSL inspection).\n\n3. Point the device to use the proxy or network access point that you have set up and start using the application.\n\n4. Go through all possible operations that the application performs.\n\n5. Inspect the non-encrypted traffic.\n    - This test __fails__ if any user data is observed.",

For example, if the opener page uses a simple `href` with `target=\"_blank\"` parameter, as specified below:\n\n`<a href=\"second.html\" target=\"_blank\">Second page</a>`\n\nThen the second page can use JavaScript to modify the content of the first page. For example, it can alter the first page's location to:\n\n`window.opener.location = 'anotherpage.html';`\n\nCombined with cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and cross-site scripting (XSS), this possibility can become very dangerous. The second page can change the location of the first page to a phishing website without the user's knowledge. When the user comes back to the first tab, the malicious page can ask for user's credentials or other sensitive information and pass such data to a malicious application.\n\nFor a demonstration of how this weakness works, [click here](http://danielstjules.github.io/blankshield/#bugtracker).",

                    "text": "Android offers several options for storing application data which include shared preferences, internal storage, external storage, SQLite database and writing data on the web.\n\n- Shared preferences are stored in application data folders ( `/data/data/your.application.package/shared_prefs/`) and are not accessible by other processes (if device is not rooted). Use `EncryptedSharedPreferences` for storing primitive data. \n\n- Note that on a rooted device, users (including hackers) and applications have access to shared preferences data as well as internal storage and SQLite data.\n\n- Internal storage is accessible to your application only if you choose MODE_PRIVATE for writing the files. Never write in MODE_WORLD_READABLE and MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE modes on internal storage which makes the data accessible to other processes (these modes are deprecated in API level 17 onward). \n\n- External storage is accessible to other processes (that have READ/WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permissions) and through USB connections. Never use external storage for writing sensitive unencrypted data. If your app targets Android 11 (API level 30) or higher, the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't affect your app's access to storage. Instead, use MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission for Android 11, which provides write access to files outside the app-specific directory and MediaStore.\n\n- SQLite database is stored as a file on the Android devices in application data folders. It is accessible to the users and hackers on rooted devices and in debug mode. Encrypt sensitive data before writing to the database or use an alternative encrypted database such as SQL Cipher.\n\nFor more information, refer to [Android Storage Options](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html).",

For example, with a browser that saves user passwords locally, or an offline password management solution, store keys securely using Java keystores.\n\n- Do not store serialized objects with sensitive data in an unencrypted format when using Java serialization and deserialization.\n    - Data in serialized objects are easy to extract and read.\n    - Treat these serialized objects as confidential data and follow the rules of handling and storing confidential data.\n\n__Note__: From Android 7.0 [`DownloadManager` cannot share _privately stored_ files by filename](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/nougat/android-7.0-changes.html#perm) ( `COLUMN_LOCAL_FILENAME`).",

                "title": "Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
                "text": "Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is the result of an attacker forging a crafted request from a vulnerable application on the server side. This attack is usually carried out to exploit other services running on the vulnerable application's server, or the resources publicly available on that server's intranet. It is usually difficult to get the vulnerable application to send requests to the Internet due to firewall settings. This attack is possible when the attacker has partial or full access over the HTTP request.\n\nConsider the following vulnerable PHP code:\n\n    if (isset($_GET['url'])) { \n        $url = $_GET['url'];\n    }\n    $image = fopen($url, 'rb');\n    fpassthru($image); }\n\nIn this code, the application makes a request using a `url` that can be controlled by the attacker. The `url` is used to fetch an image from the specified location. When an attacker carefully crafts a `url` like this, it affects all of the requests that follow. When these requests are handled by the vulnerable PHP code above, they are made on behalf of and relayed to the attacker using the `url`. All the following GET requests consist of the crafted `url` and the HOST header (`example.com`, where the PHP code is being served). \n\n- *Apache HTTP Server Status:*\n```\nGET /?url=http://localhost/server-status HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com\n```\n In the above request, the `url` is set to fetch information about the Apache HTTP Servers status. The response returned by the above PHP code (and relayed to the attacker) contains the Apache HTTP Server Status that is serving that code, given `mod_status` is enabled on that server (it is enabled by default).\n\n- *Accessing the unauthenticated information/services available on the Intranet:*\n```\nGET /?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com\n```\n The `url` in the above request is set to fetch cloud metadata. The IP address `169.254.169.254` is the standard address used by Amazon EC2 and other cloud providers for distributing metadata to cloud instances.\n\n- *Performing port scans on internal networks and gathering information about it:* by feeding different IP and port combinations into the `url` parameter in the above PHP code, an attacker can obtain valuable information regarding the intranet on which the web server hosting that code resides. The following table gives some examples of the kind of information someone can gather from the HTTP error codes and the latencies of responses:\n\n| **URL (IP+Port)** | **HTTP Response Code** | **Round-Trip delay Time** |\n|--|--|--|--|\n| http://localhost:22 | 200 | 10 (ms) | The port is open! |\n| http://localhost:23 | 500 | 10 (ms) | The port is closed. |\n| http://10.0.0.1/ | 500 | 30010 (ms) | It is blocked by a firewall or unable to route. |\n| http://10.0.0.1:8080/ | 500 | 10 (ms) | Port is closed, but traffic is routed to that address. |\n\n- *Using other URl schemes to access files on a local system or internal network:*\n```\nGET /?url=file:///etc/passwd HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com\n```\n In the above request, the `url` fed into the vulnerable php code uses a `file://` scheme to access the local files the php application may have access to. In this example, the attacker is attempting to access the `passwd` file. Depending on how the HTTP requests are made in the code, one may be able to exploit the features available with the requesting utility (for instance, cURL, fopen(), dict URL, where `fopen()` is used in the above PHP code):\n```\nGET /?url=dict://localhost:11211/stat HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com\n```\n In the above request, the `dict://` URI scheme is used. Port *11211* is the default port used by Memcached, which normally grants unauthenticated access to the local server users (via the loopback network interface - localhost). Memcached is a utility for speeding up dynamic web applications by caching the data and objects in memory.\n\n\n###External Resources:\n\n1.

Do not use blacklists and regular expressions directly on the user input as they are bad practice and can be easily bypassed. The attacker can use HTTP redirect, wildcard DNS services like xip.io, or even alternate IP encoding to bypass blacklists and regular expressions.\n- Sanitize the output of the request before relaying its response to the user. Make sure the response received by the server application is actually what it expects it to be before sending it back to the user. Prevent any information leakage to the attacker.\n- Disable unused URL schemas (i.e. `file://`, `dict://`, `ftp://` and `gopher://`), if your application only makes use of HTTP or HTTPS to make requests.\n- Operational Security Measures: use authentication on internal services such as \nMemcached, Redis, Elasticsearch and MongoDB (they do not require authentication by default).",

This may not be possible in all the scenarios but is preferable. \n\n- Develop capabilities to grant access to audit data on a read-only basis for viewing and for report generation.\n\n- Create and keep signatures of records, and verify them when accessing the records again.\n\n- Maintain the original records, and make changes to the copies if the information is of high value.\n    - Otherwise, log changes to audit data if modification is allowed.\n\n__Note:__ NIST SP 800-92 (Guide to Computer Security Log Management) provides detailed information on how to design a secure log and auditing system. The following items are listed to protect logs and make a secure logging system:\n\n- Restrict user access to log files (users usually need no more than append access privileges, if any).\n- Avoid recording unneeded sensitive data.\n- Protect log files by message digests, encryption, and physical protection.\n- Limit the processes that generate the logs.\n- Implement suitable responses to logging errors.\n- Secure the communication channel used to send log data.\n- Destroy old logs when not needed.",

Ensure that redundant UserIDs are not reissued.\n3. Maintain a repository containing details of all authorized users for each application. \n4. Regularly review the details of authorized users to ensure that access privileges remain appropriate, and that redundant authorizations have been deleted (e.g., for individuals who have changed roles or left the organization). Increase the frequency of reviews for users with special access privileges (e.g., from annually to quarterly).\n5. Restrict access to applications by using [sign-on and access control mechanisms](/library/glossary/G94/) such as passwords, tokens, or biometrics. Seek the approval of a senior business representative before any critical features of the sign-on process are bypassed, disabled, or changed.\n6. Identify the privileged access rights associated with each system and process, such as operating system, database management system, and any applications in general. Privileged access rights must be allocated to users based on a [need-to-know principle](/library/glossary/G95/).\n7. Record the allocation of privileged access rights and make sure allocation occurs only after an authorization process has taken place. \n8. Identify the condition under which all access rights must expire.\n9. Avoid the unauthorized usage of generic administration UserIDs. Great care must be exercised to maintain the confidentiality of secret authentication information for generic administrative UserIDs.\n10.Require additional levels of authentication (e.g., enable multi-factor authentication) when performing critical actions that involve [sensitive/personal information](/library/glossary/G8). For example, enable a password prompt when users attempt to change their personal/sensitive information.",

For example, usernames should consist of letters and numbers and should not have spaces or special characters at the end.\n\n- If you are implementing an application's registration/authentication system instead of using another system, __make sure the rules above are implemented__. When registering users, validate the provided username to make sure that it conforms to the predefined rules. For example, make sure that both 'admin ' (note the space) and 'admin' cannot be registered if you do not allow spaces at the end.\n\n- Write down __any changes that should be made to the username__ by the authentication/registration system to make it comply with the rules above.

Establish two or more environments (e.g., dedicated networks) in which development and testing activities can be performed separately.\n2. Isolate the development and test environments from production environments, and from each other by hosting development and test systems on a separate, standalone network, or segregating the network using a virtual local area network (VLAN) and a firewall.\n3. Protect source code used in development environments by employing malware detection and protection mechanisms.\n4. Remove all unnecessary sensitive information (e.g., authentication details, developer comments in HTML or JavaScript or sensitive information about the organization) before deploying source code on the production environment.\n5. Use access controls to prevent development staff from making unauthorized changes to production environments.\n6. Applying strict version control over development software by using configuration management, recording access in a log, and archiving old versions of software regularly.\n7. Use filtering or blocking methods to prevent malicious mobile code from being downloaded into development environments.\n8. Use integrity-checking software and configuration management tools to protect source code in development environments (including software under development, business information used in the development process, and important system documentation).\n9. If access to externally-generated application source code is not possible, maintain a copy of the code in [escrow](/library/glossary/G99/) by a trusted external party. Verify with the third party and software supplier that the code is checked regularly to ensure it is up-to-date and works correctly.\n10. Provide dedicated development endpoints on non-production networks for implementing all development-related countermeasures, and provide separate endpoints on production networks for typical enterprise tasks.\n11. Prevent differences between environments. If needed, document the difference between the development/test environment and production environment to ease the release deployment process.",

Untrusted data may cause problems not only in  HTML output but also in dynamically generated JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), or Adobe Flash components.\n\nAttackers can use this weakness to inject specially-crafted scripts into your application in order to:\n\n- Transfer private data to the attacker, such as cookies and session information.\n- Send malicious requests to a website on behalf of the victim, which is especially dangerous if the victim has administrator privileges for that site.\n- Perform phishing attacks to emulate trusted websites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that website.\n- Utilize the script to exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself, with the potential to take over a victim's machine. This is sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\" \n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim being aware of it.

                "description": "Web Messaging, or cross domain messaging, provides a means of communication between documents from different origins.\n \nIf your application does not need to receive messages from other sites, do not enable web messaging. Simply do not add any event listeners for \"message\" events.\n\nIf you use web messaging: \n\n##As the sender\n\n- When posting a message, explicitly state the expected origin (of the target) as the second argument to `postMessage()` rather than `*` to prevent sending the message to an unknown origin after a redirect, or some other means of changing the location of the target window.\n      - For example use: `newWindow.postMessage(\"Hello World!\",\"https://trusted_site.com\")\n      - Note that the second argument of `postMessage()` specifies the origin of the target window. If the hostname or port of the target window is different from the one provided at the time the messages is being sent the event will not be dispatched.\n\n\n##As the receiver\nIf web messages are accepted in the client side code by adding an event listener for \"message\", then follow these guidelines:\n\n- Check the `origin` attribute of the sent event to verify that the message is coming from the expected location.\n    - When validating `origin`, validate the full domain and avoid using loose substring matching.\n    - For example, looking for \"example.com\" as the attacker might use a domain like \"example.com.evil.com\".\n\n- Perform input validation on the `data` attribute of the event to ensure that it's in the desired format.\n    - This is especially important if you are calculating a target address from the input.\n\n- Do not use origin checks as the only security measure. \n    - In general, the message is not guaranteed to be sent by the origin that it purports.\n        - The data received through web messaging is always suspicious because the origin can easily be modified in a compromised hacker's browser. \n    - Use other methods for checking the authenticity of a message, or for authentication purposes in addition to origin.\n        - For example, signatures can be used to check authenticity.\n\n- Avoid passing data received in messages to `eval()` or adding them to DOM (by `innerHTML`, for example), as that would create a DOM-based XSS vulnerability.\n    - The only exception is when the data is strictly validated using a whitelist.\n\n__Note__:\n\nWeb messaging provides an effective InterProcess Communication (IPC) gateway for JavaScript code running in the browser. Since DOM elements are not shared between two documents and exposed to one another, this type of communication is normally safer than cross domain requests (through XMLHttpRequest). However, during web messaging, no message is sent to the server when the event happens. When the message is sent, and when it is received by the target page that has defined an event handler for \"message\", everything is managed within the browser and locally. \n\nAlways consider the fact that a hacker can create a fake message that forges an origin.",

                "description": "Follow these guidelines to perform a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA):\n\n- In a Waterfall methodology:\n\n1. Define the project and scope. A PIA is typically performed on a project or application that will collect, process/use, store, or disclose[PI](/library/glossary/G8/). Perform a conceptual PIA during the early stages of the project or application to understand what PII is expected to be involved, what entities will participate (e.g., customers, suppliers, secondary applications), and the general architecture of the project. This step will inform what security and privacy requirements are expected to secure the PII and comply with the [Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP)](/library/glossary/G86/).\n2. Analyze PII data flows. Map all proposed processes and sub-processes related to PII. Identify clusters of PII data and create a detailed diagram of how the PII flows through the organization, as well as to third parties such as vendors,  as a result of the business activities in question. Map what controls are in place to secure all PII data and meet appropriate safeguarding principles, and where controls are lacking. Map who will have access to PII at each stage of the data flows, how PII will be disseminated, how and where the PII data will be backed-up, and how privacy requests and complaints will be handled by the organization.\n3. Identify privacy risks. Identify where PII could potentially leak, be accessed by unauthorized parties, lost, or corrupted.\n4. Report on PIA results. Create a documented evaluation of the privacy risks and their potential implications, as well as a discussion of possible actions to mitigate or remedy every risk identified.\n5. Later in the project lifecycle, update  the PIA at the appropriate lifecycle stages (development, implementation, production) to assess if the controls implemented are well designed and effective to meet the security and privacy requirements and update data flow mapping and safeguarding, as well as risk assessment.\n\n- In an Agile methodology:\n\nIf relying on Agile development methodologies, the PIA is conducted along with the Agile development process, by first identifying privacy requirements, and implementing them as requirements throughout each sprint. In this situation, embedding privacy knowledge with the development team is essential, either through allocating a privacy office representative to be part of the Agile development, or by training developers on privacy.",

It is much easier to do this with a class or property file that contains the text and syntax of error messages.\n\n- Test the content of error messages for a number of scenarios. Specifically, test that the messages do not provide internal system details, such as a stack trace, information about directories, or core dump.\n\n- Work with developers, or test, that when a number of reasons have caused the error, the application does not explicitly specify the underlying reason in a way that could be used towards more directed attacks.\n\n- Verify that when more detailed error messages are provided to a specific remote system, the error messages are signed and encrypted.",

Go to View > Developer > Developer Tools.\n2. Select the __Network tab__ in the tools header. \n3. Navigate to the page you want to test. \n4. Under __Name__ in Developer Tools, select the base web page (and optionally, Type of Document). \n5. Select the __Headers__ tab\n6. Find the the Content Security Policy and X-Frame-Options settings in the Response Headers. \n\nConfirm how the headers are set with your developers. If they are set by the web server for every page, then validate them on a few pages at random. If they are being set through the web application's software, then you will need to confirm that they are being set on every page.\n\n## Type Two: Testing JavaScript Frame-busting\n\nThree How-tos are provided for this test. Use the three types of templates and replace \"target.html\" with the address of the page you are testing. \n\nFor each page and for each browser that is supported, follow these steps:\n\n1.

                "text": "HTTP specifies many different methods (or verbs), such as GET, POST, HEAD, PUT. Web applications generally use GET and POST methods exclusively for requests.\n\nMany web applications will limit which HTTP verbs can be used to access a resource (most likely GET or POST) by defining a security constraint within web.xml and explicitly listing GET and POST within separate <http-method> tags.\n\nThe HTTP HEAD method works like a GET method, except that the server must not return a message body in the response [1]. The HTTP specification intended that GET requests (along with HEAD) \"should not have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval.\" That is, GET requests should not change the state of the application&mdash;they should be indempotent.\n\nMany applications define non-idempotent GET requests. They treat GET requests like POST requests that can execute transactions that change the state of the application. An example of such a URL would be: www.myapp.org/mgmt/accts.jsp?q=delAcct.\n\nAs a result, an attacker could attempt to trap the above GET request in an HTTP proxy, modify it to a HEAD request, and submit the request. Since HEAD is not one of the HTTP methods listed in web.xml, the authorization check would be bypassed and the code that processes GET requests may be executed. This is called an HTTP Verb Tampering attack.\n\nFurthermore, some frameworks, such as Java EE, allow the use of arbitrary HTTP verbs. An attacker can send a \"BOB\" request rather than HEAD, and since it is not listed in the security constraint, the constraint will be bypassed. Arbitrary verbs will not work when accessing a Servlet, but are acceptable if the request targets a JSP directly. This is because when a JSP is compiled its components are sent to a service() method, rather than the doGet() or doPost() methods of a Servlet. Therefore, any arbitrary verb that is submitted will be directed to the service() method.\n\n[1] HTTP/1.1: Method Definitions - [http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html)",

In this case, malicious users may have access to actions they should not have.\n\nFor example, when a web application restricts access to a page called `myapp/admin_users`, once running code leaves the view layer, it may lose the context needed to continue making authorization decisions. \n\nConsider the following example:\n\n- A user calls `myapp/admin_users?action=delete`.\n- The application checks if the user has permission to access the `admin_users` page.\n- If the user has permission, then the code from `admin_page` hands execution over to a module called `admin_model`. \n- The `admin_model` is de-coupled from view logic, and no longer has authorization data on the user.\n- The application cannot check if the user has permission to use the delete action.\n\nMany applications do not perform any authorization checks at this stage. This allows users with access to `admin_users` to perform actions that should be restricted, such as modifying or deleting data.",

The syscalls allowed by SECCOMP are:\n\n* All the syscalls exposed through bionic (see below for more information). This list can be found [here](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/a89864a/libc/SYSCALLS.TXT).\n* Syscalls that permit Android to boot.\n* Syscalls used by popular Android apps for the sake of backward compatibility.\n\nOn the other hand, Android O's SECCOMP blocks certain syscalls such as swapon/swapoff because they are implicated in previous security attacks, and the key control syscalls because they serve no use in apps. The SECCOMP filter blocks 17 of the 271 syscalls in arm64, and 70 of the 364 syscalls in arm.\n\n####What is SECCOMP?\nSECCOMP is a computer security tool built in Linux and consequently Android. SECCOMP allows processes (apps in Android) to enter a secure state in which they cannot access syscalls except for `read` and `write` (from/to open file descriptors), `exit()`, and `sigreturn()`. Any other syscall causes the process to terminate using the `SIGKILL` and `SIGSYS` calls.\n\n####What is bionic? \nBionic is a standard C runtime library for Android. It includes `libc`, `libm`, `libpthread`, and `libdl`.",

When the device is not moving, the screen is off, and the device is not charging. \n    - Some features are limited or disabled in Doze/Standby modes, such as network access, WakeLocks, alarms, and syncs.\n\n- The most significant security risk of Doze mode is missing time critical triggers.\n    - If the app is using `AlarmManager`, use `setAndAllowWhileIdle()` or `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle()` functions instead of `setExact()` or `setWindow()`.\n\n- Review the design of the app and check if the app depends on any of the restricted features:\n    - This includes sync adapters, job schedulers, network connectivity, alarms, and WakeLocks.\n- Make sure none of the time-critical functions are designed in a way that are affected by the temporary unavailability of those features.\n\n - In particular, determine how the unavailability of network services affects the app.\n    - Try to use downstream messaging if continuous connectivity is needed. For example, try to use Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) in cases of time-critical notifications.\n\n- In Android O and later, background services that run without active components will have execution limitations on getting implicit broadcasts, use of other services, and receiving location updates.\n    - Analyze these limitations to check that they will not affect your app. See the Android documentation on [behavior changes in Android O](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/android-8.0-changes.html#all-apps).\n\n- If Doze can affect the core functionality of the app, consider whitelisting it from power-saving.\n    - See the whitelisting section in the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html#whitelisting-cases). \n\nWhile it is unlikely that the details of Doze can affect your app development, [see this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBPQZEU_ofg) for more information about light and extended Doze mode.",

It changes BIOS, firmware, master boot record (MBR), volume boot record (VBR), bootloader or any part of the system involved in the boot process and injects some malicious code that loads before the operating system (OS). Since the bootkits precede the OS and their components reside completely outside of the standard file systems, they get full control over the system and are hard to detect by typical means, such as anti-malware tools run by the operating system.\n\nPlatform integrity is also important if your application depends on the features provided by the firmware on the platform, especially security controls. An attacker may modify the firmware to circumvent some security controls. For example, on a game console, attackers can flash the firmware to remove code that checks the signatures on games installed on the platform, and can consequently run non-genuine versions of the game.",

In proxy->intercept, make sure the \"intercept is off\" button is toggled. For instructions on how to set up Burpsuite with your browser, see [Burp Suite Setup Guide](/library/glossary/G11/ \"Burp Suite Setup Guide\").\n3. Authenticate into the application as the higher-privileged user.  \n4. Find functions which should be accessible only by the higher-privileged user, such as administrative functions.  \n5. Perform one such transaction. For example, view an \"edit users\" page if this is an administrative function.  \n6. Now log out and authenticate as the lower-privileged user.  \n7. In Burpsuite, go to proxy->intercept and switch to \"intercept is on.\"  \n8. In the browser, view a page or function as the regular user.  \n9. In Burpsuite, go to proxy->history and find the request from step 5. View the \"request\" tab on the bottom of the window. Copy the query string of the request (i.e. the string after GET or POST), including any parameters (e.g., \"?name=a&val=124\").  \n10. In Burpsuite, go to proxy->intercept and view the \"Raw\" tab. Change the path of the current request to the one you copied from step 9.  \n11. If the request from step 9 was a POST request, copy the text from the data section and paste it into the current request from Step 10.  \n12. In Burpsuite, go to proxy and turn off intercept.  \n13. Observe the browser. If you are able to view the higher-privileged page or function, then this test fails.",

In proxy->intercept, make sure the \"intercept is off\" button is toggled.  \n3. Authenticate into the application. \n4. In Burpsuite, go to proxy->history and find the request from step 2. Make note of the authentication URL and the parameters that contain the username and password.  For instructions on how to setup Burpsuite with Firefox,  see [Burp Suite Setup Guide](/library/glossary/G11/ \"Burp Suite Setup Guide\").\n5. Gather a set of at least three valid and three invalid usernames.  \n6. Open the attached [python script](https://preview.sdelements.com/static/attachments/test_auth_timing.py) and scroll down to the section that says '''''''CHANGE HERE.''''''' Change the \"loginurl\" variable to the URL of the authentication request.  \n7. In the same python script, the \"set_of_parameters\" variable contains 6 lines of username and password pairs. The first entry on each line is \"username,\" which is the name of the parameter that contains the username. Change this to the correct parameter name for your application. The second entry on each line is the value of the username parameter. The third entry on each line is \"password,\" which is the name of the password parameter -- change this to the corresponding entry in your application. The last entry on each line is the value of the password parameter. Since we are testing invalid passwords only, you do not have to modify this field.  \n8. Change the usernames in step 6 to alternate between valid and invalid users on each line.  \n9. Run the Python script. The output will print out how long it took to perform authentication and receive a response back from the server for each username/password pair. If you notice a significant difference between valid and invalid usernames (e.g. more than a quarter-second), run the script a couple more times. If the invalid usernames are consistently taking less or more time to authenticate than valid usernames, this test fails.",

Additionally, your application must properly authorize each access request.\n\nFor example, suppose that ___User A___ is authorized to see a page that shows their account information:\n\n `https://somedomain.com/showmyaccount?id=52`\n\n ___User A___ must not be allowed to see ___User B___'s information by using the link below, even if ___User A___ has logged into the system as a valid user:\n\n `https://somedomain.com/showmyaccount?id=53`",

Note that this includes logout features, which are often mistakenly implemented as a `GET` operation.\n* `POST`: Submit information to the server. In a REST context, used to create a new resource.\n* `PUT / PATCH / DELETE`: Used in a REST context to manipulate the resource at the given URL (create, update and delete).\n\n__Not respecting these methods might violate implicit security assumptions__. For example, CSRF defenses assume that `GET` requests never change state.

Ensure information available to the general public, without identification and authentication, does not contain nonpublic content.",

Consider keeping the admin interface on a private subnet and off the public internet.\n\n-Use second level authentication and consider using client SSL certificates for accessing admin areas. \n\n-Only allow access from trusted domains and IPs. This can be done by adding a check to a basic HTTP pipeline or by blocking untrusted IPs in access configuration files.\n\n-Reissue the session ticket when moving between admin and normal users.",

                    "text": "## Description\n\nJavaScript frame-busting methods are usually based on two logical steps:\n\n1. A \"conditional statement\" testing if the page is loaded in an iFrame.\n2. A \"counter-action\" statement moving the page out of the iFrame.\n\nIt is shown that most of the JavaScript frame-busting techniques could be evaded by attackers. The best known approaches are based on these two measures:\n\n1. Informing user about the iFrame\n2. Hiding everything by default and making the page visible only if certain conditions are met.\n\n## Guidance\n\nIf you want to use JavaScript for frame busting:\n\n### 1. Inform user about the situation \n\nAlert the user in the event that an attack is detected.\n\n### 2. Use 'style' to hide everything and only show the content if the page is not loaded in an iFrame\n\n          <style > html {display:none;} </style >\n          <script>\n          if ( self == top ) {\n           var theBody = document.getElementsByTagName('html')[0];\n           theBody.style.display = \"block\";\n          } else {\n          alert(\"The page seems to be loading inside an iFrame. This is a security risk. Close the tab!\");\n          top.location=self.location;\n          }\n          </script>\n           <HTML> \n           If this text is shown inside an iFrame, your page is vulnerable.\n           </HTML>\n\nThis is not part of JavaScript code, but it is recommended that you put this tag in the header of HTML:\n\n            <head> <meta http-equiv=\"X-Frame-Options\" content=\"deny\"> </head>\n\n\n[Download the Complete Code Example](https://preview.sdelements.com/static/code/Web/web.iFrameBusting.zip)\n\n\n\n### 3. Check the referrer using JavaScript:\n\nIf your application allows some pages to be framed by your own site (or another domain), make sure you check `document.referrer` properly. Here is an example using regular expressions:\n\n           if (document.referrer && document.referrer.match((/^https?:\\/\\/([^\\/]+\\.)?mysite\\.com(\\/|$)/i))) \n\n\n***\n\n## Beware of the following techniques\n\nFor several years JavaScript has been used wrongly for protection against click-jacking. Skip the rest of this how-to if you have used the instructions given above. Read through if you are using legacy code. Scripting similar to the following __do not work__ as protections against attacks:\n\n* `if (parent.frames.length == 0) ...`\n* `if (top.location == self.location) ...`\n* `if (top.location == location) ...`\n\n### Insufficient Referrer Analysis\n\nDo not only search for a string in the text. For example `if (document.referrer && document.referrer.indexOf(\"myWebsite.com\")==-1)` __does not__ properly check the referrer. A sub-domain like this: `myWebsite.AnotherDomain.com` will satisfy the requirements while not being from the trusted domain.\n\n",

                "description": "Do not allow your application to be loaded in an `iframe` unless you need that functionality. Different strategies can be applied to deny framing. \n\n1. Instruct the browser to prevent framing using HTTP response headers (`X-Frame-Options` and `Content Security Policy`). __This is a current best practice__.\n2. Use JavaScript code that detects unwanted framing and prevents abuse. This technique is also known as *frame busting*. It is considered deprecated. More information is available in the JavaScript How-to.\n\nBelow you will find different scenarios explaining how to configure the HTTP response headers. \n\n\n\n## Deny framing\n\nMost modern applications do not depend on the framing of their pages. If none of the pages need to be framed, framing can be turned off completely. To do so, the server should send the following two headers on every response with an HTML page that does not need to be framed.\n\n```\nX-Frame-Options: DENY\nContent-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'\n```\n\nThis configuration is supported by all major browsers.\n\n\n\n## Allow framing within your origin\n\nWhen framing is needed, it is often restricted to the application itself. When the page including a framed page is from the same origin, the server should send the following two headers on every response containing an HTML page that should be framed by your origin.\n\n```\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nContent-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'\n```\n\nThis configuration is supported by all major browsers.\n\n\n## Allow third-party framing from one origin\n\nWhen a single origin needs to be able to frame an application page, it needs to be explicitly listed. The server should send the following two headers on every response containing an HTML page that should be framed by the third-party origin.\n\n```\nX-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM https://example.com\nContent-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors https://example.com\n```\n\nThis configuration allows `https://example.com` to frame the page in the response. \n\nThis configuration is supported by all major browsers.\n\n\n## Allow third-party framing from multiple origins\n\nWhen multiple origins need to be able to frame an application page, they all need to be explicitly listed. Unfortunately, the `X-Frame-Options` header only allows a single value to be listed. The more recent `Content-Security-Policy` supports multiple values, __but is not supported by Internet Explorer__. \n\nThe server should send the following header on every response containing an HTML page that should be framed by one of the third-party origins.\n\n```\nContent-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors https://one.example.com https://two.example.com\n```\n\nThis configuration allows `https://one.example.com` and `https://two.example.com` to frame the page in the response. \n\nThis configuration is supported by all major browsers, __except IE__. It is supported in Edge.\n\n\n### Preventing framing in Internet Explorer ###\n\nIf your application needs to support Internet Explorer and needs whitelisting from third-party origins, things get challenging. There are a few options you can follow.\n\n1. Implement a dynamic `X-Frame-Options` header using the `Referer` header to determine who is trying to frame you. This solution requires matching the `Referer` header against a list of approved origins, and sending back the right value in the header.\n2. Accept the risk of potential clickjacking attacks against users of Internet Explorer. To mitigate the risk, you can implement short session lifetimes, as well as re-authentication before performing sensitive operations.\n\nNote that JavaScript-based framebusting will not work, since JavaScript cannot read the URL of the parent frame across origins. \n\n\n\n## A Note on Cross-Domain Meta Policy\n\nThe content of your website can also be loaded in PDF and Adobe Flash documents. If you want to allow specific domains to embed your content in these documents, specify them correctly in `crossdomain.xml` files on your server. \n\nOtherwise, disable this feature:\n\n1. Remove all `crossdomain.xml` files from your server.\n2. Configure your server to send a ***X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies*** response header with the value ***none*** with each response.\n\nFor more information read [this guide on cross domain policy files](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-a-guide-to-cross-domain-policy-files--active-3832).",

                "text": "When an HTML page opens a new window using a hyperlink, the opened window may get access to the opener page through JavaScript (depending on some parameters). For example, if the opener page uses a simple `href` with `target=\"_blank\"` parameter, as specified below:\n\n`<a href=\"second.html\" target=\"_blank\">Second page</a>`\n\nThen the second page can use JavaScript to modify the content of the first page. For example, it can alter the first page's location to:\n\n`window.opener.location = 'anotherpage.html';`\n\nCombined with cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and cross-site scripting (XSS), this possibility can become very dangerous. The second page can change the location of the first page to a phishing website without the user's knowledge. When the user comes back to the first tab, the malicious page can ask for user's credentials or other sensitive information and pass such data to a malicious application.\n\nFor a demonstration of how this weakness works, [click here](http://danielstjules.github.io/blankshield/#bugtracker).",

However, it does not work for all the browsers.\n\n* For all user input that can open external windows:\n    - Make sure `rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"` values are added to hyperlinks before posting. For example, add these values for a forum or chat-room that users can submit hyperlinks to.\n\n* Alternatively, if you use JavaScript to open the window, set the opener attribute to null:\n    - `<script>var A = window.open(); A.opener = null; A.location = 'B.html';</script>`\n\n* For Safari browsers:\n    - Open an intermediary iFrame (<iframe src=\"C.html\"></iframe>) and open a `C.html` file in the iFrame.\n    - `C.html` can in turn open the target HTML file (`B.html`) using the JavaScript code shown above:\n        - (`<script>var A = window.open(); A.opener = null; A.location = 'B.html';</script>`)\n\n* Consider using [a framework/project similar to this](http://danielstjules.github.io/blankshield) for consistently changing links as specified above.\n\n* __Note 1__:\n\n- You can test the `B.html` file for possible attacks by using code like this:\n    - `<script>if (window.opener) {opener.location = 'http://www.yahoo.com';} else {document.write(\"Safe Use!\")}</script>`.\n    - If access to the original page is possible, the original (opener) window will be redirected to the Yahoo page.\n\n * __Note 2__:\n\n - `noopener` works for most browsers and is enough to restrict access to the opener page in most cases.\n\n * __Note 3__:\n\n - Set `noreferrer` for the `rel` attribute in hyperlink reference to protect older browsers.\n    - Since the behavior of browsers changes very quickly, it is important to test these in the browsers that your application is opened.\n        - Test this when specifying multiple values for `rel` [space-separate the values](https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#adef-rel) (`rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"`).",

An attacker can exploit this if you use the downloaded data without sufficiently verifying its origin, integrity, and size.\n\nAttackers can execute malicious code by compromising the host server, performing DNS spoofing, or modifying the code or data in transit. Attackers can also cause a denial of service attack by feeding your application with large bulks of data.\n\nThe risk is especially higher when the downloaded data resides on shared resources that are accessible to other applications, or when they are transferred over an unsecured network. For example, files are at risk when they are stored in the shared external storage of a mobile device.\n\nUsing third-party servers, for example, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to host files such as Javascript libraries and CSS stylesheets that are shared among multiple sites can also increase the risk of the remote content being manipulated by attackers. CDNs can improve site performance and conserve bandwidth; however, using third-party hosted content comes with a risk, in that if an attacker gains control of the third-party server, the attacker can inject arbitrary malicious content into files (or replace the files completely) and thus can also potentially attack all sites that fetch files from that third-party content provider.",

Set tighter endpoint-specific restrictions depending on their function to minimize the attack surface.\n\nLimit the following request attributes:\n\n- Request body size\n- Number of request header fields\n- Request header fields size\n- Request line size\n- XML request body size\n\n# Server timeout\n\nTune the connection __timeout__ settings of the server. A higher connection timeout gives the server more time to engage with the application. This increases the likelihood for various types of server attacks, such as [Slowloris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris_%28software%29).\n\n__Note:__ A small value may introduce issues with the legitimate users with slow connections. Set timeout values based on your normal connection statistics.\n\nTune the following timeout settings:\n\n- Request read timeout\n- Keep-alive timeout\n\n# Server connections and backlog capacity\n\nTune the maximum number of __simultaneous connections__, and increase the capacity of the backlog of pending connections where possible.\n\n__Note:__ The backlog prolongs a denial of service (DoS) attack because it holds incomplete requests (including malicious ones), but reduces the impact of small attacks.\n\nMost web and application servers provide a configuration option for each of these limits. See the server-specific documentation, and review your application needs when adjusting each of these settings.\n\n## Considerations\n\nThe meaning of \"reasonable\" varies according to a system's available resources and an application's features and needs. Consider the following:\n\n- A maximum URL size of 2000 characters is considered reasonable and supported by most browsers. \n    - Smaller values (256) might interfere with features such as single sign-on.\n\n- While a 1 MB limit on HTTP request sizes is reasonable for most applications, it might restrict file upload speeds where applicable.\n\n- Maximum number of concurrent connections:\n    - Carefully review the operational environment, hardware, and software resources, such as system memory available to the HTTP server.\n    - There is no common value that works for all environments.\n\n- Decreasing the keep-alive time-out might have a small performance impact. \n    - A value above 60 seconds is not recommended according to [Apache Performance Tuning](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/misc/perf-tuning.html).\n\nFor more information about web server security, see [Apache Security Tips](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/misc/security_tips.html).",

                    "text": "## Description\n\n Verifying `Origin:` header in cross origin resource sharing (CORS) is not an adequate measure for access control (See Notes below). There is no guarantee that CORS requests are sent by an actual browser (which follows HTML5 protocols), and there is no guarantee that those request are not forged or manipulated. Checking origin in addition to normal authentication/authorization mechanism can prevent unintended access to data and services on the server.\n\n- If your application's access control and session management is based on cookies (as opposed to query parameters or form fields) enable sending cookies by setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` response header (from server) to 'true' (see code below).\n\n- If the request is sent from the browser over plain HTTP channel but the origin shows HTTPS prefix do not process the message or return an error. Include both secure and non-secure versions of the website in the allowed Origin list. Here is a sample list of allowed Origins:\n\n`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://www.mydomain.com http://www.mydomain.com https://subdomain.anotherdomain.com http://subdomain.anotherdomain.com` \n\n- Use a white-list for trusted `Origin:`s. Avoid returning the request header `Origin:` value in the response header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin:` which means that you are responding to any request (Read the notes below to see the consequences). Use wildcard, `*`, in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` only for the service that are publicly accessible and do not return any sensitive data in their return values or HTTP headers.\n\n- Make sure you include the domain of your server in the white-list (of trusted origins), to allow accepting same-origin requests. If your server code returns an error when the `Origin` doesn't match a list of allowed domains, and your server is not in that list, same origin requests are blocked. \n\n- Use the response header `Access-Control-Max-Age:` to enforce a time limit on the CORS sharing period (in seconds).\n\n- Note that according to [W3C Specifications](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#preflight-request) user credentials should be excluded from the preflight request. Therefore, the preflight request cannot be authenticated. You should not rely only on authentication when the request method is OPTIONS. Do authentication for any other request method (any HTTP verb such as GET and POST). \n\n- Based on the server's technology the above requirements are fulfilled differently. To enable CORS for your server see (this links)[http://enable-cors.org/server.html].  \n In case that you need to handle parts of the communication here is some guidelines. For example analyze the code below in PHP (the code is only demonstrative and could be modified for other target languages):\n\n             <?php\n             if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'OPTIONS')\n             //HTTP and HTTPS \n             if  ( ( ($_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'] == \"https://www.mydomain.com\") \n              and (!empty($_SERVER['HTTPS']) ) ) // Check if the origin matches the connection type (SSL) \n              or\n             ($_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'] == \"http://www.mydomain.com\")\n              or\n             ($_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'] == \"http://subdomain.anotherdomain.com\")\n              or\n             (($_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'] == \"https://subdomain.anotherdomain.com\") \n              and (!empty($_SERVER['HTTPS']) ) \n              ) )\n            {\n             // List of the domains that are allowed to access our services through CORS \n             header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://www.mydomain.com http://www.mydomain.com https://subdomain.anotherdomain.com http://subdomain.anotherdomain.com');\n             // Maximum time that the browser can cache preflight response (in seconds) \n             header('Access-Control-Max-Age: 3600');\n             // Send cookies with the actual request\n             header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true');\n\n             }\n             else // if not OPTIONS\n             {              \n             // Perform authentication/authorization for any request type that is not OPTIONS.\n             // Check the origin and return it in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin. Send an error or empty response (with valid headers) when the origin is not trusted.\n             // Note that some browsers do not send preflight requests (OPTIONS).\n             // Make sure that no part of the code is reached without authentication and checking of Origin. \n              validate_origin();\n              perform_authentication();\n              \n              }\n              \n             ?>\n\n Cookies are not sent by default. If cookies are not needed, do not set `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header.\n\n\n## A Note on CORS and Access Control\n\n Checking the origin, is helpful when we want to prevent a malicious website from accessing user data on our server or performing unauthorized actions. For example suppose that a malicious site (___M___) which is not trusted by our server (___S___) is visited by a genuine user (___U___). ___M___ could use CORS capabilities to request data or an action from ___S___ if it was trusted. If ___U___  has already logged into ___S___, all the session cookies are stored in ___U___'s browser, and a malicious script from ___M___ could access sensitive data made available through CORS requests and send such data to ___M___ (Note that CORS allows sending ___U___'s credentials to ___S___ which enables ___M___ to pass the authorization step and perform the actions it intends to).\n\n However Origin header, does not help much if the user (___U___) is a hacker. A hacker can install a plugin on the browser (or forge requests) to pretend that the CORS requests are coming from a trusted website. In that case it is the access control that can stop the hacker, from attaining unauthorized information.\n",

                    "text": " Cross site request forgery (CSRF) could become a more complicated problem when combined with CORS. A trusted site (T) by your server (S) can send cross site requests that are malicious (e.g. as a result of HTML injection into that site (T)). If these requests use CORS capabilities (based on the trust that S has to T), they can divulge user information to a hacker.\n\n For this reason, `Origin:` headers are not suitable means to avoid CSRF. Normal anti-CSRF tokens should be added to messages, and verified by the server (S). For learning how to add anti-CSRF protection to your application see the related how-tos for using anti cross site request forgery (CSRF) tokens.\n\n If anti-CSRF method is based on cookies/sessions (as opposed to query parameters or form fields) the server side component should enable sending cookies by setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` response header (from server) to 'true'. Note that cookies are not sent with preflight request (user credentials should be excluded from the preflight request according to W3C specifications).\n\n Depending on the server's technology it is achieved differently. For example in PHP this piece of code sends the required response headers (the code is only illustrative and could be easily changed for any target language):\n\n            <?php\n            if($_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'] == \"http://trustedwebsite.com\")\n            {\n             header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://trustedwebsite.com');\n             header('Access-Control-Max-Age: 3600');\n             header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true');\n              }\n             ?>\n\n Note that some browsers do not send OPTIONS preflight requests (`if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'OPTIONS')...`). Always test your code with the major browsers and those that are supported.\n Cookies are not sent by default.\n\n",

If a match is found, return appropriate `Access-Control-Allow-...` headers.\n        - Do not use partial whitelist matching (e.g., `contains()`, `startsWith()`, `endsWith()`) to avoid bypass attacks\n\nAdditionally, take the following considerations into account.\n\n- Use the response header `Access-Control-Max-Age:` to enforce a time limit on the caching of the CORS policy in the browser (in seconds).\n- Send the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` header on all requests that require credentials (e.g., cookies, client certificates). \n- If the request is sent from the browser over a plain HTTP channel, but the origin shows an HTTPS prefix, do **not** process the message or return an error.\n- If you are building an isolated application, consider moving frontend and API into the same origin to benefit from same-origin requests.\n\nIn all cases, fail securely, and return a minimum amount of information.",

                "description": "To test a CORS policy, you will need to send cross-origin requests to the application's backend. The easiest way to achieve this is by using the [Postman tool](https://www.getpostman.com/), or a command line tool such as [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/). The instructions below assume you are using these tools or similar ones.\n\nFollow these instructions to verify CORS security:\n\n- Verify that the application performs authentication/authorization if the service is not public.\n    - Send a CORS request to an application endpoint using an HTTP request tool\n\t    - Send a custom `Origin` header containing a trusted value, that is also returned in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.\n    \t- Do not include any authorization state (credentials, cookies, custom headers, ...)\n   \n    This test __fails__ if you can access protected services without authentication.\n\n- Test that the authentication covers all HTTP verbs.\n    - Send requests with different HTTP verbs (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS)\n\t    - Send one set of requests without `Origin` header. These requests mimic same-origin behavior.\n\t    - Send another set of requests with an `Origin` header with a trusted value. These requests mimic cross-origin behavior. \n\t    - Do not include any authorization state (credentials, cookies, custom headers, ...)\n\n    This test __fails__ if you can access a service or page that needs authentication in any of the above cases.\n\n- Test that the origins are properly verified.\n   - Send requests with an `Origin` header that contains a non-trusted origin (e.g., `https://evil.com`).\n\t\t- Include authorization state on these requests (e.g., a cookie, a custom header, ...) \n   - Make sure you run these tests for various non-trusted domains\n   - Look for tricky combinations. For example, to test an application accepting cross-origin requests from `https://www.example.com`, you could use the following values for the `Origin` header:\n   \t\t- `https://www-example.com` (bypasses regexes using the `.` as a wildcard)\n   \t\t- `https://notexample.com` (bypasses partial matching)\n   \t\t- `https://example.com.evil.com` (bypasses partial matching)\n   \t\t- `http://example.com` (bypasses partial matching)\n\n    This test __fails__ if you get any response other than the `Invalid CORS request` response.\n\n- Test that the origins are properly verified.\n\n- Work with developers, or analyze the responses, to make sure that you do not return 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *' for non-public services.\n    - While this is tested in the previous step, due to its prevalence, it is worth being verified again.\n\n- Test that anti-CSRF measures protect CORS requests too.\n    - For every endpoint that does not require a CORS preflight, CSRF protection needs to be validated.\n\t    - Send a trusted cross-origin request with authorization state, but without CSRF tokens\n\n    This test __fails__ if you can access the target service/page without a CSRF error.\n\n\t__*Note:*__ Endpoints requiring a preflight (e.g., accepting the `application/json` content type) are protected against CSRF by means of the CORS policy (i.e., malicious origins will not be accepted by the policy)\n\n- Work with developers to make sure that if you use part of the input for calculating the request target, you are validating the input.\n    - For more information, see [Input validation issue, XSS with CORS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Test_Cross_Origin_Resource_Sharing_(OTG-CLIENT-007)).",

                "text": "The application is vulnerable to **cross-site scripting (XSS)** if it does not correctly neutralize user input before it is placed in the output content. For example, the word `<script>` is an untrusted user-provided string when reflected without neutralization in any HTML output. It would be interpreted as a new HTML tag by web browsers and may cause unintended changes in the application's behavior. Untrusted data may cause problems not only in  HTML output but also in dynamically generated JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), or Adobe Flash components.\n\nAttackers can use this weakness to inject specially-crafted scripts into your application in order to:\n\n- Transfer private data to the attacker, such as cookies and session information.\n- Send malicious requests to a website on behalf of the victim, which is especially dangerous if the victim has administrator privileges for that site.\n- Perform phishing attacks to emulate trusted websites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that website.\n- Utilize the script to exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself, with the potential to take over a victim's machine. This is sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\" \n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack so the request looks less suspicious.",

Verify that the scope for the TRA is established, related to the purpose of the assessment and the risk environment.\n3. Verify that a team with the knowledge and skills needed to collect essential information was assembled, that it analyzed the data, and that it recommended meaningful solutions to meet the business objectives of the organization. \n4. Verify that the required resources are identified and responsibilities are assigned with a realistic schedule for TRA activities.\n5. Verify that vulnerability reports have been reviewed and that statistics for previous software were used to inform the security risk assessment.\n6. Verify that all assets within the scope of the assessment were listed, and that the level of impact that might reasonably be expected to arise in the event of a compromise to the confidentiality, availability or integrity of each asset was determined. Assets and their values should be ranked from least to most valuable.\n7. Verify that meaningful threats and risks which might affect assets within the scope of the assessment were listed, and that the probability of each threat or risk actually occurring plus their potential impact were assessed. Assign levels for each threat or risk based on their likelihood and impact. Produce a list of threats and risks ranked from the most serious to the least.\n8.

Identify the remaining vulnerabilities that expose assets to the identified threats or risks.\n9. Verify the effects of vulnerabilities on the likelihood of each threat or risk occurrence, the probability of compromise, and the severity of ensuing damage were assessed. Assign the relative levels for each vulnerability based on the increased exposure to the compromise of confidentiality, availability or integrity. Produce a list of vulnerabilities ranked from the most serious to the least.\n10.

                "description": "Follow these guidelines for adopting the best permission management strategy for your Android application:\n\n- First determine if the application actually needs a particular permission, or if it can use other applications or services through Intents instead. \n    - See this guide to help make this decision: [Consider Using an Intent](http://developer.android.com/training/permissions/best-practices.html#perms-vs-intents).\n\n- After you make sure you need some permissions, design a strategy for requesting the permissions.\n    - Familiarize yourself with both types of permission requests:\n        - The old model with static permissions before Android Marshmallow.\n        - After Android Marshmallow when permissions are asked at runtime.\n\n- Identify the best time to ask for permissions.\n\n    **Here are the main points you need to consider when asking for permissions:**\n\n    - Ask for permissions when required, and do not overwhelm users with permission dialogs. Starting in Android 11, there is __only this time__  option in the user-facing permissions dialog whenever the app asks permission related to a microphone, camera, or location. \n    - After asking for permission, give something back to users immediately. For example, if you ask for permission to use the camera, show the pictures so that the user knows why the permissions are granted.\n    - Ask for permission first, then if the user refuses, provide an explanation. If the user refuses again, do not insist, otherwise, the user may check the \"never ask again\" box. Starting Android 11, if users choose to __Deny__ specific permission more than once during the app's lifetime on a device, they do not see the system permission dialog box when the app asks that permission again.\n    - Do not assume to have permissions as with Android 6 and earlier.\n    - Design the application in a way that checks for permissions before using them.\n\n- Distinguish between the types of permissions that are used by your application (normal and dangerous).\n    - Dangerous permissions need user approval.\n    - Never assume that a permission remains in the same category and group.\n        - Permissions are frequently regrouped, so do not assume that receiving permission for a major group will give you all permissions in that group.\n    - Always ask/check for a permission if you use it. In apps that target Android 11 or higher, the system automatically resets the sensitive runtime permissions that the user had granted and have been unused for a few months.\n\n- Design a test plan for testing the application against both permission models (before Android Marshmallow and after).",

                        "text": "Obtaining user locations can raise privacy concerns. Hence, there are several best practice guidelines that developers must follow.\n\nStarting with Android 12, users can limit their installed applications to access only the approximate location of their device. Therefore, try to avoid having your application access a device's fine location unless it's necessary. If you must use `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`, be sure to also include `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` in the same runtime request. If the user does not grant your application permission for fine location access, you can ask that the user upgrades your application's location access from approximate to precise. To do so, describe why you need the fine location access and then request the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` and `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` permissions together again. Since the application already has the `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` privilege, the operating system will show a different dialogue that asks the user for fine location access.\n\nInitially, ask only for foreground location permission. If you need background location access, you can perform incremental requests. In this way, you can provide more control and transparency to the users and they will better understand which features in your app need background location access. For example, you can first guide the users into services that require foreground location access and disable the app features that require background location access. Later, if the user chooses app functionality that requires background location access, you can request it.\n\n For more information, refer to [Android developers guide](https://developer.android.com/training/location/permissions).",

                    "text": "## Establishing HTTPS Connections\n\n- Use the `HttpClient` or `URL::openConnection` interface for accessing HTTPS services. Android Marshmallow promotes obtaining `HttpURLConnection` (or HttpsURLConnection) by calling `URL.openConnection()`. The `URL::openConnection` interface is provided in `java.net.URL`. See this example:\n\n        URL url = new URL(\"https://www.test.com\");\n        URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();\n\n- Calling `openConnection()` with an \"HTTPS\" address will return an `HttpsURLConnection`. For more information, see the Android developer documentation about [HttpURLConnection](http://developer.android.com/reference/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html).\n\n- The `HttpClient` interface is provided in `org.apache.http.client.HttpClient`. However, Android Marshmallow has discontinued supporting the Apache HTTP client. In order to use Apache HTTP APIs (if you must), specify the following in the `build.gradle` file (compile-time dependency): `android { useLibrary 'org.apache.http.legacy' }`\n\n- See [this article](http://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-ssl.html) from the Android developer documentation for using HTTPS and SSL securely. Pay special attention to the section [Unknown certificate authority](http://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-ssl.html#UnknownCa) because it explains how to make a keystore with your trusted CAs (see the section on TrustStore below for more information).\n\n## Validating Chain of Trust\n\n- When overriding `TrustManager`, do __not__ bypass the super class functionality under any circumstances. Call the super class as the first step (see the code sample below).\n- If the secure connection is used for non-HTTP-based protocols, the hostname of the certificate must be validated explicitly/manually against the expected host name. This can be done using `setHostnameVerifier` of the `SSLSocketFactory` prior to creating an SSL Socket, or by getting the peer certificate's host field after the session is established via `SSLSession.getPeerCertificates()` and validating it explicitly.\n- All mentioned libraries use the underlying `TrustManager` to validate certificates. The default implementation of `TrustManager` performs the following validation for certificates:\n\n     - Validates basic fields including expiry and critical extensions.\n     - Follows the chain of trust until it reaches a trusted root authority as specified in the `KeyStore` (also called TrustStore). __If the KeyStore is not explicitly provided, the system's default `KeyStore` (TrustStore) is used.__ See the section on default TrustStores below.\n\n## Sample Code\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to safely override the TrustManager class in order to ping accepted certificates in the application to a certain certificate authority/issuer.\n\n -- src/com/example/androidcertificatepinning/AndroidCertificatePinning.java\n\n    ....\n    @Override\n    public void onCreate(Bundle

SSL Factory of the application to the new instance we have created\n            // All HTTPS / SSL access libraries will now use our new class instead of the system\n            // default\n            HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultSSLSocketFactory(ctx.getSocketFactory());\n        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {\n            // Log or handle the exception accordingly\n            // We exit

Default TrustStore\n\nTrustStore has the same structure as KeyStore, but its purpose is to store trusted certificates (TrustStore is not an actual Java class, and the term is used to refer to the functionality for a KeyStore mentioned above). The default TrustStore in Java is `JAVA_HOME\\jre\\lib\\security\\cacerts`. Use these commands to see all the trusted certificates stored in this file:\n\n           System.setProperty(\"javax.net.debug\", \"all\");\n           SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getDefault();\n          // The output should look like this:\n          // keyStore type is : jks\n          // trustStore is: ...\\Java\\jdk1.8\\jre\\lib\\security\\cacerts\n          // init truststore\n          // adding as trusted cert:\n          // Subject: CN=Equifax Secure Global eBusiness CA-1, O=Equifax Secure Inc., C=US\n          // Issuer:  CN=Equifax Secure Global eBusiness CA-1, O=Equifax Secure Inc., C=US\n          // ...\n\nOne common approach is to add a custom company-specific certificate authority into the default cacerts file for internal use before the application is actually deployed and a proper certificate is obtained and installed. `keytool` is a powerful command-line tool that is used for generating new keys, listing keys, and performing a variety of actions. Within an organization, there are three steps commonly done together to manage trust: Creating a cryptographic key for signing, exporting the public details so that others can trust your key, then having users import it to trust it. \n\nIf you want to generate and add a certificate to cacerts run these commands (the default password of cacerts is: `changeit`):\n\n- Generate a key pair:\n`keytool -genkeypair -alias TestKey -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 365 -keystore my.jks`\n- Export a certificate:\n `keytool -exportcert -keystore my.jks -alias TestKey -file mykey.cer`\n- Import to cacerts:\n `keytool -importcert -keystore cacerts -alias ATrustedKey -file mykey.cer`",

The client might completely miss or improperly follow the chain of trust, and validate host-specific data, certificate expiration, or certificate revocation. This will allow an attacker to persuade the client to trust a malicious SSL certificate, essentially allowing a man-in-the-middle attack, among others.\n\nThe certificate validation process should also include checking that the certificate is not revoked or expired (certificate's revocation status).",

Any application using __SSL__ or __public key infrastructure (PKI)__ based authentication must do the following at the very least:\n\n * Follow the chain of trust for certificate validation.\n    * Verify that each node in the chain has a valid certificate by itself and has the authority to sign the child certificate.\n\n * Validate host specific data of certificates to make sure it matches the expected destination.\n    * For instance, make sure the Common Name matches the expected value.\n\n * Validate the expiry date of the certificate.\n\n * Check certificate revocation.\n    * Use certificate revocation lists (CRLs) or online certificate status protocol (OCSP).\n \n * Re-check certificate revocation periodically after the initial revocation check. \n    * You can do this by either:\n        * Re-checking the revocation list for every connection (avoid caching).\n        * Setting the cache to expire after a period of time (one week, or 24 hours in more security-sensitive environments).\n \n * Do not accept or initiate SSL connections for which the certificate misses one or more of the validation steps above.\n\n__Note__: Authentication/SSL systems should be designed and implemented in a way that certificate validation, revocation status verification, and user authentication do not impose impeding latency on the system.\n\nLibraries like OpenSSL or operating system interfaces might automatically perform certificate validation.\n\n * Ensure you review the specifications of the specific SSL library/interface and make sure that proper settings/parameters are used to activate all the checks listed above.\n\n * Handle all potential warnings and errors that might arise from any of these checks failing.\n\n * Use the latest versions of your library and check for vulnerabilities in the specific version of the library/interface that you are using that might be used to bypass the validation process.\n\nAs the number of certificate authorities grows, there is more and more risk associated with certificates. Forging valid certificates by compromised signing authorities and social engineering for impersonation during the certificate issuing process are becoming increasingly common. To reduce the risk associated with certificate-based trusting you may wish to include the following additional measures:\n\n * Only use reputable signing authorities for your own certificates.\n\n * Ensure that clients validate the specific signing authority your organization uses.\n    * For example, by hard-coding and checking the fingerprint of the signing authorities.\n \n * Only use Extended Validation (EV) certificates and limit accepted certificates to EV certificates on the client side.",

Moreover, the phone gets turned off, app gets crashed, or for any other reason the cache file stays there, the next time the app is launched, it will get removed.\n\n -- src/com/example/androidcaching/AndroidCachingActivity.java\n\n    public class AndroidCachingActivity extends Activity {\n        public static final long DISPLAY_FREQUENCY = 5 * 1000; // Every 5 seconds\n\n        // This is a sample Session ID\n        // In a real application, this comes from the authentication module\n        public static final String SAMPLE_SESSION_ID = \"1234567890ABCDEF\";\n\n        /** Called when the activity is first created. */\n        @Override\n        public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n\n            try {\n                // We are making a sample temporary file using a 1 minute expirty for demo purpose\n                File tmp_file = new CacheMonitor(this.getCacheDir()).getTempFile(\"test\", \n                    SAMPLE_SESSION_ID, 1);\n                // And write some stuff into it\n                FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(tmp_file);\n                BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);\n                bw.write(\"Hello World\");\n                bw.newLine();\n                bw.close();\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                // Log or handle the exception accordingly\n                // We exit here for safety reason as the certificate pinning mechanism is not enabled\n                System.exit(-1);\n            }\n\n            CacheMonitor monitor_thread = new CacheMonitor(this.getCacheDir());\n            monitor_thread.start();\n\n            this.showFileList();\n        }\n\n        ...\n\n        public void showFileList() {\n            TextView tv = new TextView(this);\n            tv.setText(\"Time is: \" + new Date().toLocaleString() + \"\\nCached files are ->\\n\");\n            File[] cache_files = this.getCacheDir().listFiles();\n            for (File cache_file : cache_files)\n                tv.append(cache_file.toString() + \"\\n\");\n\n            setContentView(tv);\n\n            final AndroidCachingActivity caller_class = this;\n            Handler handler = new Handler();\n            Runnable doTask = new Runnable() {\n                public void run() {\n                    caller_class.showFileList();\n                }\n            };\n            handler.postDelayed(doTask, DISPLAY_FREQUENCY);\n        }\n\n        ...\n -- src/com/example/androidcaching/CacheMonitor.java\n\n    public class CacheMonitor extends Thread {\n\n        // In Minutes -- Default Temporary file expiration\n        public static final long DEFAULT_TMP_EXPIRY = 30;\n\n        public static final long MONITORING_FREQUENCY = 10 * 1000; // Every 10 seconds\n        private File cache_dir;\n\n        public CacheMonitor(File cache_dir) {\n            super();\n            this.cache_dir = cache_dir;\n        }\n\n        /** Get a temporary file.

For example, if you add two large positive integers the result may be negative. The inverse is true for negative numbers.\n\nOther operations such as subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents can be vulnerable as well. This is of particular concern if you use at least one untrusted number in an operation, such as a user-supplied number.\n\nTo avoid overflow, you can cast one of the operands or the result to a primitive with more bits. For example, you can cast a **short to an int** or an **int to a long** in most languages. Alternatively, you can use logical checks to test for overflow. \n\nAssuming o1 is operand 1, o2 is operand 2, and r is the result, you use the following checks:  \n\n * For o1 * o2 = r, check that r / o2 = o1  \n * For o1 ^ o2 = r, check that log r base o2 = o1  \n * For o1 + o2 = r, check that r > 0  \n * For o1 + o2 = r:\n    - If o1 and o2 are both positive, then check that r > 0\n    - If o1 and o2 are both negative then check that r < 0",

Identify high-value transactions in the application. For any single transaction identified, perform the rest of this test.  \n3. In Burpsuite, click on proxy->history and view the request. Right-click and select \"Send to comparer\".\n4. Log out of the application and log in as the same user.\n5. Repeat step 3 with similar data and send the request to comparer tab again. Now you should have two requests in the comparer.\n6. Go to the comparer tab and compare those two requests. Identify the unpredictable parameters (that are different in two messages), which will be called _P_ here (Note that the input values that you entered are not among those values).\n7. Send the latest request (step 5) to repeater.\n8. Go to repeater tab and find the request from step 7. Replace _P_ values in the request with some random values (Try to adhere to the same format and length of inputs). Do not change cookie values.\n9. Click \"Go\" button.\n10. If the transaction is successful this test fails.\n\n__Note__: It is helpful to understand what we are trying to achieve by the test here. When a hacker creates a CSRF link, and tricks the users to click it, he can build a complete request which contains all the fields that are required by the target page except the ones with unpredictable values (_P_), that are actually checked at the target page. Since cookies are on the client, they are sent with each request. In the test we have kept the cookies, and predictable parts of the transaction intact, but have changed the unpredictable parts in step 9. It is especially important to change tokens which are normally (but not necessarily) called `_csrf` or `_csrfToken` to see if they are verified. ",

Determine which transactions are considered \"high-value\" according to your business.\n    - For example, transactions with personal safety, monetary, or brand reputation impact. \n\n3. Choose one transaction.\n    - Repeat the rest of the test for all those transactions, or make sure the entire application uses the same safeguards for CSRF.\n\n4. Determine how the transaction is requested.\n    - For example, it may use a request form with input values, which is submitted to a destination page to process the request. This is called a POST method.\n    - Alternatively, the transaction may be enabled by a single hyperlink. This is possible through a GET method with a query string containing parameters.   \n\n5. Use an HTTP proxy or HTML inspecting tool to save the content of the HTTP request sent to the target page that processes the transaction. \n    - You can use a tool such as Burp Suite, Chrome Developers Tools, or Firefox FireBug/TamperData.\n\n6. Record the entire request including headers.\n\n7. Delete the browser's history, and log in again as the same user.\n\n8. Go to the same page again, but intercept the request before sending it to the target.\n    - Replace the unpredictable parts of this request with some random values with a tool such as TamperData or Burp Suite. \n        - Parts that cannot be predicted include random tokens you see in the request.\n    - Do not replace cookies.\n\nThis test __fails__ if you can perform the transaction successfully.\n\n## Method Two\n\n1. Find the transaction that you would like to test.\n\n2. Create an HTML page to initiate the request.\n    - For GET requests, the transaction could be initiated simply with a hyperlink with parameters.\n    - For a POST method, create a form with all the values that the request page sends including the hidden inputs.\n        - Replace the unpredictable values with some random values or values that an attacker can guess. \n\n3. Clear your browsing history and log into the application.\n\n4. Use the page in step 2 to send the request.\n\nThis test __fails__ if you can perform the transaction successfully.",

                    "text": "Java has three classes for generating random numbers: `Random`, `SecureRandom`, and `ThreadLocalRandom`:\n\n - The `Random` class is the most common and can be used for unimportant random calculations, such as the random selection of images. The output of this class is not random and can be predicted by attackers, since it follows a predictable pattern.\n\n- `ThreadLocalRandom` is effectively the same class as `Random`, but it offers a different random generator per thread. This class is most useful for basic random numbers.\n\n- __The `SecureRandom` class generates true random numbers.__ This class should be used to generate random numbers in any application that security and unpredictability matters. Therefore, it is often accepted as an argument to cryptographic functions. Use this class as follows:\n\n          SecureRandom r = SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong();\n          byte[] rnds = new byte[20];\n          r.nextBytes(rnds);\n\nSome points regarding the use of SecureRandom:\n\n- `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` returns the strongest available algorithm based on the value of `securerandom.strongAlgorithms` in the `$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security` file (see [the full list of algorithms here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html#SecureRandomImp)). \n- `SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong()` blocks the thread as opposed to just using `SecureRandom r = new SecureRandom()`, which does not block the thread.\n- You do not need to manually seed the algorithm (specifying the start point that is used to generate the random number sequence). If you have not specifically seeded the object/algorithm using the `setSeed(...)` function, the first call to `nextBytes(...)` will force the `SecureRandom` object to seed itself.",

For example, session ID numbers must be random numbers or strings that cannot be guessed by attackers.\n\nMost programming languages come with simple random number tools, such as rand() in C, which don't have enough entropy. In many cases, these Pseudo Random Number Generators (PRNGs) use a predictable value to seed a predictable sequence of random numbers, such as the system time. \n\nUse methods for the generation of cryptographic keys and other material (such as IVs), which have entropy that meets the minimum effective strength requirements of the cryptographic primitives and keys\n\nProvide sufficient entropy in related processes, where cryptographic keys are generated through processes that require direct user interaction, such as through the entry of a passphrase or the use of __random__ user interaction with the software. Specifically:\n\n - Enforce an input domain that is able to provide sufficient entropy for any methods used for generating keys directly from a password/passphrase , so that the total possible inputs are at least equal to that of the equivalent bit strength of the key being generated (e.g., a 32-hex-digit input field for an AES128 key).\n\n- Make sure that a work factor of at least 10,000 is applied where the passphrase is passed through an industry-standard key-derivation function, such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt, which extends the work factor for any attempt to brute-force the passphrase value. \n\nMost programming languages also provide cryptographically secure random number generators, which have passed security tests for pseudo-randomness. For example, the SecureRandom class in Java or Microsoft CryptoAPI. Use these libraries instead.\n\nA typical case of using cryptographically secure random number generators could be generating v4 GUIDs. Details are mentioned in the additional requirement **ASVS Requirements - GUID v4 algorithm.** \n\n**Note**: The SHA1PRNG algorithm that is widely used for random number generation is no longer considered cryptographically strong and should be avoided in critical applications.",

These tools include Appache JMeter, WebLOAD, and loadUI.\n- The tool needs to be able to send requests with different sizes and check the performance.\n\n    This test __fails__ if large requests break the services.\n\n__Notes:__ \n\n- You should also pay attention to external services that are called within your services. If you receive input from other services within your code, you should also test that your system cannot be brought down by a malicious or malfunctioning external service.\n\n- This countermeasure might not be required if your architecture is designed in a way that a single request creates consistent and low load on your server by using DDoS protection techniques such as an approved DNS or TCP/IP load balancing. Check whether your application is still vulnerable to amplification attacks after using such techniques. If so, then apply the requirements in this countermeasure .",

Document a [cryptographic key management process](/library/glossary/G96/) that covers the lifecycle of cryptographic keys, responsibilities of key owners, protection requirements for cryptographic keys, and how to handle [mandatory key disclosure](/library/glossary/G97/).\n2. Assign the ownership of cryptographic keys to individuals who are aware of their responsibilities for using and protecting keys (and, where necessary, disclosing keys). Discuss and confirm that they clearly understand their responsibilities for using and protecting cryptographic keys.\n3. Use unique cryptographic keys for providing security to critical assets, including both confidentiality and authenticity, as well as for providing other security services to the software (such as authentication of end-point or software updates) have a unique purpose. For example, no key may be used for both encryption and authentication operations.\n4. Implement strict access controls and secure backups to ensure that cryptographic keys are protected against access by unauthorized individuals or applications, accidental or malicious destruction, and unauthorized copying.\n5. Implement methods and procedures to revoke or replace public or open-box keys that are not unique per software instantiation.\n6. Consider revoking encryption keys whenever:\n    - Personnel with knowledge of the key leave the company or the role for which the knowledge was necessary.\n    - A key is suspected of or known to be compromised.\n7. Limit the use of a cryptographic key to a single purpose. This prevents multiple exposures on the occasion of a key compromise.",

                "text": "If your application runs in an environment that does not check the integrity of the platform, it would be vulnerable to **bootkits** installed on the platform or **modifications** to the firmware of the platform.\n\nA bootkit is an advanced malware that tampers with a system's boot process. It changes BIOS, firmware, master boot record (MBR), volume boot record (VBR), bootloader or any part of the system involved in the boot process and injects some malicious code that loads before the operating system (OS). Since the bootkits precede the OS and their components reside completely outside of the standard file systems, they get full control over the system and are hard to detect by typical means, such as anti-malware tools run by the operating system.\n\nPlatform integrity is also important if your application depends on the features provided by the firmware on the platform, especially security controls. An attacker may modify the firmware to circumvent some security controls. For example, on a game console, attackers can flash the firmware to remove code that checks the signatures on games installed on the platform, and can consequently run non-genuine versions of the game.",

Establish an asset classification model or scheme that applies across the organization.\n2. Use the asset classification model to structure varying levels of confidentiality of information (e.g., restricted, confidential, internal use, and public). Each classification level must have a description, taking into account the potential business impact from the loss of confidentiality of information, and examples to guide future classification efforts.\n3. Describe what the handling requirements are for each level of classification at each stage of the application lifecycle, and explain how to handle conflicting classifications (e.g., use the worst case scenario or highest classification level).\n4. Update the security policies and standards to state that information must protected in line with its assigned level of classification.\n5. Review each significant application with its owner to assign a classification level. Ensure the owner sign-off on the agreed classification level, and that the classification level is re-assessed at least annually (and when major changes happen to the application).\n6. Ensure that your asset classification process documents all [Key Asset Attributes](/library/glossary/G66/). \n7. Record your applications (assets) in an inventory or equivalent (e.g. a database, specialized software).\n8. Review what applications are accessed or used by customers, service providers, and external suppliers and mark them as externally accessed or used assets on your inventory. Ensure that they understand the requirements to protect data according to its classification and your requirements. Update existing agreements as required, and ensure that new agreements contain the appropriate data handling requirements. \n9. Communicate the asset classification model and its handling requirements widely across the organization (e.g., as part of communications and training of all staff using assets).\n\n**Note:** You can use an analysis technique to identify critical assets. Some examples include:\n\n- Mission Impact Analysis (MIA)\n- Functional Dependency Network Analysis (FDNA)\n- Mission Threat Analysis\n- Refer to NIST Special Publication 800-160 or in other publications such as EMVCo, ISO, or ANSI for more analysis techniques.",

To configure an FQDN, a record should be configured in your DNS pointing the host to your server's public IP address and a line in your `/etc/hosts` file referencing the FQDN. For more information about this, refer to [set a FQDN](https://linode.com/docs/networking/dns/using-your-systems-hosts-file/).\n\n- Create a certificate file to use with the client. Example below shows creating a certificate file to use with .NET client:\n\n````\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -in client-cert.pem -inkey client-key.pem -certfile cacert.pem -out client.pfx\n````\nAs shown above, PEM file is converted to PFX because the .NET client does not support PEM file format.\n\n- Authenticate the client. Example below shows how to  connect using SSL mode with the connection string option:\n\n````\nusing (MySqlConnection connection = new MySqlConnection(\n  \"database=test;user=sslclient;\" +\n  \"CertificateFile=H:\\\\git\\\\mysql-trunk\\\\mysql-test\\\\std_data\\\\client.pfx;\" +\n  \"CertificatePassword=\"+GetCertPassword()+\";\" +\n  \"SSL Mode=Required \"))\n{\n    connection.Open();\n}\n````\n\nTo learn about provisioning a certificate in MS SQL Server, check the [SQL Server example](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-encrypted-connections-to-the-database-engine?view=sql-server-2017).",

Prevent using ciphers that provide SSL/TLS compression to protect against [Crime Attack Vectors](/library/glossary/G10/) that use compression side channels to extract information from encrypted channels.\n5. Use the latest version of the SSL library and web servers:\n    - SSL v1.0, v2.0, and v3.0 are no longer considered secure.\n    - OpenSSL is an open-source, commercial-grade toolkit for TLS/SSL protocols, and a cryptography library. It includes default protocol level mitigation factors enabled against BEAST (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS) attacks.\n    - Apache 2.2.24 provides a directive for disabling SSL/TLS Compression.\n6. Ensure that the server side selects the most secure cipher from the list of ciphers common to both client and server by providing preference ordering of the ciphers.\n7.

And if the above-mentioned problems are not critical to you, force TLS on all pages to enable a higher level of security for your application.\n\n__Note__: Even if part of the application does not particularly perform any sensitive actions or collect sensitive data, allowing non-TLS access to those parts causes non-secure cookies (the ones that don't have \"secure\" flag set to true on them, [see T22](/library/tasks/T22/)) to be sent over unencrypted channels. Those cookies can be stolen by any eavesdropper on the network. Other small problems in the application could also be exploited much more easily when the whole application is not TLS-enforced.\n",

The server component must explicitly disable EXPORT ciphers to protect the clients against __Factoring RSA Export Keys__ (FREAK) attacks.\n- Strictly avoid DES ciphers (not to be confused with 3DES). They have a short key and can be broken easily by brute force using inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware.\n- Where available, use Ephemeral key exchange ciphers over standard ones. That is, use __ECDHE__ over ECDH and __DHE__ over DH.\n- Regarding DH-based key changes, choose ECDH\\* over DH\\* due to better performance. ECDH\\* provides the same amount of protection as DH\\* but the former requires fewer resources.\n- Never use ciphers that use MD5 for MAC.\n    - MD5 has two known weaknesses: collision and pre-image.\n- Never use SHA1. Use SHA384 or SHA256 instead.\n    - SHA1 has been fully and practically broken.\n    \nThe following provides a list of [recommended ciphers](https://ciphersuite.info/cs/?sort=asc&software=gnutls&singlepage=true&security=secure&tls=tls12):\n\n- TLS\\_ECDHE\\_ECDSA\\_WITH\\_AES\\_128\\_CCM\n- TLS\\_ECDHE\\_ECDSA\\_WITH\\_AES\\_128\\_CCM\\_8\n- TLS\\_ECDHE\\_ECDSA\\_WITH\\_AES\\_128\\_GCM\\_SHA256\n- TLS\\_ECDHE\\_ECDSA\\_WITH\\_AES\\_256\\_CCM\n- TLS\\_ECDHE\\_ECDSA\\_WITH\\_AES\\_256\\_CCM\\_8\n- TLS\\_ECDHE\\_ECDSA\\_WITH\\_AES\\_256\\_GCM\\_SHA384\n- TLS\\_ECDHE\\_ECDSA\\_WITH\\_CAMELLIA\\_128\\_GCM\\_SHA256\n- TLS\\_ECDHE\\_ECDSA\\_WITH\\_CAMELLIA\\_256\\_GCM\\_SHA384\n- TLS\\_ECDHE\\_ECDSA\\_WITH\\_CHACHA20\\_POLY1305\\_SHA256\n- TLS\\_ECDHE\\_PSK\\_WITH\\_CHACHA20\\_POLY1305\\_SHA256\n- TLS\\_ECDHE\\_RSA\\_WITH\\_AES\\_128\\_GCM\\_SHA256\n- TLS\\_ECDHE\\_RSA\\_WITH\\_AES\\_256\\_GCM\\_SHA384\n- TLS\\_ECDHE\\_RSA\\_WITH\\_CAMELLIA\\_128\\_GCM\\_SHA256\n- TLS\\_ECDHE\\_RSA\\_WITH\\_CAMELLIA\\_256\\_GCM\\_SHA384\n- TLS\\_ECDHE\\_RSA\\_WITH\\_CHACHA20\\_POLY1305\\_SHA256\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_DSS\\_WITH\\_AES\\_128\\_GCM\\_SHA256\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_DSS\\_WITH\\_AES\\_256\\_GCM\\_SHA384\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_DSS\\_WITH\\_CAMELLIA\\_128\\_GCM\\_SHA256\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_DSS\\_WITH\\_CAMELLIA\\_256\\_GCM\\_SHA384\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_PSK\\_WITH\\_AES\\_128\\_CCM\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_PSK\\_WITH\\_AES\\_128\\_GCM\\_SHA256\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_PSK\\_WITH\\_AES\\_256\\_CCM\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_PSK\\_WITH\\_AES\\_256\\_GCM\\_SHA384\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_PSK\\_WITH\\_CAMELLIA\\_128\\_GCM\\_SHA256\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_PSK\\_WITH\\_CAMELLIA\\_256\\_GCM\\_SHA384\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_PSK\\_WITH\\_CHACHA20\\_POLY1305\\_SHA256\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_RSA\\_WITH\\_AES\\_128\\_CCM\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_RSA\\_WITH\\_AES\\_128\\_CCM\\_8\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_RSA\\_WITH\\_AES\\_128\\_GCM\\_SHA256\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_RSA\\_WITH\\_AES\\_256\\_CCM\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_RSA\\_WITH\\_AES\\_256\\_CCM\\_8\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_RSA\\_WITH\\_AES\\_256\\_GCM\\_SHA384\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_RSA\\_WITH\\_CAMELLIA\\_128\\_GCM\\_SHA256\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_RSA\\_WITH\\_CAMELLIA\\_256\\_GCM\\_SHA384\n- TLS\\_DHE\\_RSA\\_WITH\\_CHACHA20\\_POLY1305\\_SHA256\n- TLS\\_PSK\\_DHE\\_WITH\\_AES\\_128\\_CCM\\_8\n- TLS\\_PSK\\_DHE\\_WITH\\_AES\\_256\\_CCM\\_8",

Uncheck `listen on lookback interface only` and click on `Update`.\n\n6. Make sure `running` is checkmarked.\n\n7. Under `intercept client requests` and `intercept server requests`, uncheck the `intercept if` box.\n\n8. Setup the device to use the proxy you just set up and start using the application.

The client might completely miss or improperly follow the chain of trust, and validate host-specific data, certificate expiration, or certificate revocation. This will allow an attacker to persuade the client to trust a malicious SSL certificate, essentially allowing a man-in-the-middle attack, among others.\n\nThe certificate validation process should also include checking that the certificate is not revoked or expired (certificate's revocation status).",

Set up a proxy that can intercept TLS/SSL traffic by decoding the TLS/SSL. \n    - For example, the Burp Suite or Charles proxies.\n\n2. Set the proxy to listen in on the access point, and enable TLS/SSL decoding using self-signed certificate replacement.\n\n3. Set the client to use the proxy by choosing the access point and the port to be used.\n\n4. If the client does not support proxies:\n    - You can use a proxifier to redirect traffic through the setup proxy.\n    - Or you set up transparent proxy mode and force network traffic by setting the proxy on the routing gateway of the network.\n\n5. This test fails if the application continues to operate without giving errors and all functions continue working. \n\n6. Check the TLS/SSL connections logged in the proxy.\n    - This test __fails__ if the connections are fully established, and data is being sent.\n    - Otherwise, this test passes.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/)\n- [Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/)",

This is a security risk. \n\nThe risk would be eliminated if the broadcast receiver checked the Intent action:\n\n            public class MyOperationClass extends BroadcastReceiver {\n            @Override\n            public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {\n            if(intent.getAction().equals(\"android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED\"))\n            {\n            //... To do\n            Toast toast = Toast.makeText(context,\"Broadcast Received Here!\",Toast.LENGTH_LONG);\n            ....  }\n            ...}}\n\n\nArbitrary components cannot send Intents with system actions, so a component cannot try to specify an action like this:\n\n           intent.setAction(\"android.intent.action.ACTION_SHUTDOWN\");\n           this.sendBroadcast(intent);\n\nThis creates a permission denial exception when trying to broadcast this Intent. Normal applications cannot get shut-down broadcast permission.",

While legitimate users need a mechanism to recover access to their accounts, these mechanisms should be properly secured.\n\nPassword recovery features can be misused by attackers, and can completely undermine secure password authentication. Design these features carefully so that they don't become a system's weakest link.\n\nWeaknesses in password reset features include the following:\n\n- Security questions are easy to guess or look up.\n- Confirmation emails include the password in clear text, or can be sent to non-user email accounts.\n- Password reset features do not have a throttling feature to prevent denial of service (DoS) attacks that can lock out a user account.\n- The original account password is sent to the user instead of a new temporary password.\n- Valid user accounts can be collected based on the system's response to entering a username into the password reset feature (user enumeration).\n- Not initializing password reset tokens with a random value, and leaving them as *NULL* in the database, can lead to unwanted password resets.",

This prevents locking out legitimate user accounts, while also reducing the likelihood of a brute-force attack.\n\nWhen the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded, the **throttling mechanism** must automatically do one of the following:\n\n- Lock the account or node for a predetermined period.\n- Lock the account or node until it is released by an administrator.\n- Delay the next login attempt using a suitable algorithm. \n\nA **delay algorithm** will increase the time a user must wait between login attempts until it becomes impractical for a brute-force attack.\n\n __Note:__ \n\nThe authentication throttling feature must also prevent __denial of service (DoS)__ attacks. These attacks lock down legitimate user accounts through automated login attempts. Use a CAPTCHA image, or IP-based throttling to prevent these automated attacks.\n\n__Note:__\n\nMake sure __soft__ account lockout, which happens automatically by the application, is kept separate from __hard__ account lockout, which happens by administrators.

The salt value is then appended to the result of the hash and given as the result of the `encryptPassword(String)` method. A `checkPassword(String, String)` method is provided to check a plaintext password against the hashed, salted equivalent automatically.\n\nNote that due to the number of iterations and size of the password, both of these methods are slower than most other password encryption tools. In web applications, new user registrations and authentication attempts occur infrequently in comparison to other transactions, so the net impact on performance will be minimal.\n\n## Code\n\n    public static boolean login (\n        String username,\n        String password,\n        String ipAddress\n    ){\n\n        //Initiates Jasypt authenticator\n        StrongPasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor = new StrongPasswordEncryptor();\n\n        try {\n            String encryptedPassword =\n                AuthenticationService.getCredential(username);\n            if (passwordEncryptor.checkPassword(password, encryptedPassword)) {\n                if (AuthenticationService.isUserLockedOut(username)){\n                    throw new LoginException(\"User locked out\");\n                }\n\n                return true;\n            } else {\n                throw new LoginException(\"Invalid username and/or password\");\n            }\n        } catch (LoginException e){\n            //Register the invalid authentication attempt\n            AuthenticationService.registerAuthenticationFailure(\n                username, ipAddress, e\n            );\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n[Download the Complete Code Example](https://preview.sdelements.com/static/code/J2EE/j2ee.authentication_examples.war)\n\n## 3rd Party Libraries\n\nJasypt",

                "description": "To improve the security of hashed passwords, add a unique salt to each password and hash the result before storing it. A salt value is a set of random bytes added to original input before it is hashed.\n\n### Best practices\n\n__When generating or storing a salt__:\n\n- __High entropy__: Use a secure random generator to generate unpredictable values. At the very least, salt values should be the same length as the output of the hash function. Do not use a username for a salt value.\n- __Uniqueness__: Do not re-use salts between users or entries.\n- __Storage__: Salts can be stored in the same table or place as the hashed passwords. Salt values do not need to be confidential. However, based on ASVS 4 (2.4.5) and NIST 800-63b, as defence-in-depth, consider storing it separately (e.g on an HSM device) to make brute-force attacks on the hashed passwords impractical in case a breach happens.\n\n__When hashing passwords__:\n\n- __Secure hash__: Use a secure hashing algorithm to prevent identical hashes (collision). Recommended hash functions are Argon2, BCrypt and SHA-2. **Avoid** using SHA-0 and SHA-1.\n- __Slow hash__: Use slow hash algorithms because they take more time to calculate. This makes brute-force attacks more difficult to carry out. Make sure to hash values multiple times (iteratively), and hash a salted password at least a thousand times.\n\n__Note__:\nWithout adequate authentication throttling, slow hashing can lead to denial of service (DoS) attacks.\n\n__Implementation__: \n\n- Avoid integrating hashing functions into your code. Instead, use a field-tested library that performs the hashing and salting for you. __RFC2898__ introduces Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2), which is implemented by many libraries and vendors. We recommend using `PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256`.\n\n### Benefits of a salt\nUsing a randomized salt before hashing has two major benefits:\n\n1. __Prevents rainbow attacks__: Rainbow attacks use a table of pre-calculated passwords and hashes to gain unauthorized entry. When a different salt is used for each user, rainbow attacks become more difficult and inefficient to use for an attacker. When unique salts are used to calculate a hash, identical passwords will not produce identical hashes.\n2. __Increases complexity__: Salting a value increases the complexity of its hash, either by increasing its length or by adding special characters. This makes dictionary attacks much more time-consuming.",

Passwords are handled differently (see following examples).\n             public static String encrypt(byte[] key, byte[] initVector, String value) throws Exception {\n              IvParameterSpec iv = new IvParameterSpec(initVector);\n              SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(key, \"AES\");\n              Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING\");\n              cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, skeySpec, iv);\n              byte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(value.getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));\n              String encoded = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(encrypted);\n              return encoded;\n           }\n           public static String decrypt(byte[] key, byte[] initVector, String encrypted) throws Exception {\n             IvParameterSpec iv = new IvParameterSpec(initVector);\n             SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(key, \"AES\");\n             Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING\");\n             cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, skeySpec, iv);\n             byte[] original = cipher.doFinal(Base64.getDecoder().decode(encrypted));\n             return new String(original);\n           }\n           private static String bytesToHex(byte[] bytes) {\n             StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n             for (byte b : bytes) {\n               sb.append(String.format(\"%02X \", b));\n             }\n             return sb.toString();\n           }\n\n\n## 2) Send information securely over the Internet (Asymmetric Cryptography)\n\nIn this case, we want to open a secure connection to a remote web server and check its X.590 certificate. Once we have the server certificate, we test to ensure it chains back to a root that ships with Java. The following code fragment demonstrates the process.\n\n          public static final boolean checkTrustedCertificate( X509Certificate[] certs, URL url) throws KeyStoreException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, UnknownHostException, IOException {\n          boolean valid = false;\n\n          SSLSocketFactory factory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();\n          SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket)factory.createSocket(url.getHost(), url.getDefaultPort()); \n          SSLSession session = socket.getSession();\n          String keyexchalgo = getKeyExchangeAlgorithm(session);\n\n    try { \n        socket.close();\n    } catch( IOException e ) {}\n\n    TrustManagerFactory trustManagerFactory = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());\n    trustManagerFactory.init((KeyStore)null);\n    // you could use a non-default KeyStore as your truststore too, instead of null.\n    for (TrustManager trustManager: trustManagerFactory.getTrustManagers()) { \n        if (trustManager instanceof X509TrustManager) {\n            X509TrustManager x509TrustManager = (X509TrustManager)trustManager; \n            try {\n                x509TrustManager.checkServerTrusted(certs,keyexchalgo);\n                valid = true;\n            } catch( CertificateException e ) {\n                // Eat the stacktrace\n                logger.error( \"url=\"+url.toString() );\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return valid;}\n\n\nFor an idea of the type of metadata included in an X.509 certificate, consider the following dump using the OWASP DeepViolet tool:\n\n             [Server certificate information]\n             Trusted State=>>>TRUSTED<<<\n             Validity Check=VALID, certificate valid between Tue Jan 03 12:08:00 PST 2017 and Mon Apr 03 13:08:00 PDT 2017\n             SubjectDN=CN=securitycurmudgeon.com\n             IssuerDN=CN=Let's Encrypt Authority X3, O=Let's Encrypt, C=US\n             Serial Number=284509671358157103109227291976164022995273\n             Signature Algorithm=SHA256withRSA\n             Signature Algorithm OID=1.2.840.113549.1.1.11\n             Certificate Version =3\n             SHA256(Fingerprint)=FD:3A:53:EE:4D:6E:F9:DD:DE:67:7E:E7:76:34:5A:54:CD:87:E6:DA:65:E8:D4:E5:94:4E:AB:D2:03:E4:59:F3\n             Non-critical OIDs\n             AuthorityInfoAccess=[ocsp=http://ocsp.int-x3.letsencrypt.org/ | caIssuers=http://cert.int-x3.letsencrypt.org/]\n             CertificatePolicies=[2.23.140.1.2.1=1.3.6.1.4.1.44947.1.1.1=qualifierID=http://cps.letsencrypt.orgCPSUserNotice=This Certificate may only be relied upon by Relying Parties and only in accordance with the Certificate Policy found at https://letsencrypt.org/repository/]\n             AuthorityKeyIdentifier=[A8:4A:6A:63:04:7D:DD:BA:E6:D1:39:B7:A6:45:65:EF:F3:A8:EC:A1]\n             SubjectKeyIdentifier=[3C:82:DA:31:4F:71:00:E2:34:37:ED:9A:CA:CD:7D:B0:88:3E:93:F1]\n             ExtendedKeyUsages=[serverauth clientauth]\n             SubjectAlternativeName=[securitycurmudgeon.com | www.securitycurmudgeon.com]\n             Critical OIDs\n             KeyUsage=[keycertsign]\n             BasicConstraints=[]\n\n## 3) Secure hash (Message Digests)and passwords\n\nA message digest result is beneficial for identifying modified files. On the Java platform, you can generate a SHA3-256 digest like this:\n\n             private void printHash() throws Exception {\n             MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA3-256\");\n             byte[] bIn = \"test content to hashs\".getBytes(\"UTF-8\");\n             byte[] bOut = md.digest(bIn);\n             for( int i=0; i< bOut.length ; i++) {\n             System.out.print(String.format(\"%02x\", bOut[i]));\n             }\n             System.out.println();\n             }\n\nFollowing is an example of a SHA3-256 digest:\n\n`5e4e1fab4e1e205b9ecd76064dfb68fce1f517c601dc9dbe7e46f47aaf7335e4`\n\nSmall changes in a hashed string cause wild fluctuations in the digest results. For example, changing the string slightly to \"test content to hashes\" produces the following SHA3-256 hash:\n\n`efab4425234dad7bfc4fc432f66c3e0f4a8908ba51181081098eeffe01d0d402`\n\nAltering the string by even a single character produces an entirely different digest result. Hashes are great for identifying changes in data. This works well to test the integrity of a file or network data.\n\nPasswords are a special case and hashing alone is not enough. An attacker can easily precompute a table based upon common dictionary words, called a Rainbow Table. Rainbow tables are particularly useful when stored password hashes are exfiltrated. If attackers can match rainbow table values against the password values, then the password is identified by the dictionary word. A better solution combines several security measures for strong password defense.\n\nBrief summary of password protection methodology is as follows:\n\n- Step 1) Plan text password. Plain text password UTF-8 encoded.\n- Step 2) Output value of step 1 is hashed with SHA512 algorithm. This ensures a consistently high entropy for all passwords regardless of length.\n- Step 3) Output value of step 2 is encrypted with an HMAC function. bcrypt is recommended, alternatively PBKDF2 if a Java only solution is required. The HMAC function should use a high iterator and a per user salt value.\n- Step 4) Output value of step 3 is encrypted with AES256. A global (application instance hash) pepper is provided to the hash function along with the output of step 3. Output of step 4 is the finished hash suitable for storage or comparison.\n\n`PLAIN TEXT PASSWORD --> UTF-8 --> SHA512 --> HMAC(bcrypt) ---> AES256 --> SECURE PASSWORD`\nNote: The approach is described in detail by DropBox [here](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2016/09/how-dropbox-securely-stores-your-passwords/)\n\n\n## 4) Secure random numbers (Cryptographically Secure Number Generation)\n\nThere are a lot of methods to create random numbers in Java and many are insecure or weak. In Java 9+, you can use the DRBG (Deterministic Random Bit Generator) to generate a secure random number in accordance with NIST specification, \"NIST Special Publication 800-90A Revision 1, Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators (800-90Ar1)\". Consider the following code sample.\n\n             SecureRandom sr = SecureRandom.getInstance(\"DRBG\", DrbgParameters.instantiation(256, DrbgParameters.Capability.PR_AND_RESEED, \"PersonalizeThisString\".getBytes()));\n             byte[] key = new byte[32]; // nextBytes() places the result in key, a 256-bit result.\n             sr.nextBytes(key);",

[Annex A Section 14](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/documents/fips%20140-3/Draft%20FIPS-140-3-CMVP%20Management%20Manual%2009-18-2020.pdf) provides a list of approved security algorithms applicable to FIPS 140-3.\n     - For example, Data Encryption Standard (DES) is not considered secure and an alternative such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) should be used for symmetric encryption.\n- Use any unapproved algorithms only in conjunction with approved algorithms and implement it in a manner that does not reduce the equivalent cryptographic key strength provided by the approved algorithms.\n\n- Do __not__ use __encoding and compression algorithms__ instead of encryption algorithms. For example, a common mistake is using a type of encoding to protect data, such as Base64 encoding. Base64 encoding is not an encryption algorithm and does not protect data. It can be reversed using Base64 decoding without the need for any additional shared knowledge (such as knowledge of a shared key). Techniques such as Base64, ROT13, GZip, LZW, Huffman coding, etc., should __not__ be used for protecting data in place of encryption algorithms.\n- Use a key management system that provides features for secure generation, distribution, storage, change, and retirement or revocation of cryptographic keys.\n- Always initialize the initialization vectors (IVs) used in the algorithms with secure random values. \n- Always use cryptographically secure random IVs when using a block cipher in cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode. \n    - A predictable IV can cause an affected system to be vulnerable to plaintext attacks. \n    - Use encryption in CBC mode instead of Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode.\n\n- Always incorporate an industry-accepted standard padding method, where padding is used prior to or during encryption.\n\n- Do not reuse the same cryptographic key for multiple purposes.\n- Use only approved, collision-resistant hash algorithms and methods with a salt value of appropriate strength that is generated using a secure random number generator.",

The maximum number of concurrent connections and connections backlog capacity.\n\nFor each of these items, complete the following steps:\n\n1. Ask developers and review documentation, or server settings, for the maximum value for the attribute.\n    - If you are unable to obtain this information, assume it is an excessively large, but reasonable value as the upper bound.\n\n2. Attempt to send an HTTP request (or a set of concurrent requests) with the attribute slightly larger than the maximum value determined in step 1.\n    - You can use [Burp Suite](http://portswigger.net/burp/) or [Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/) to create and send arbitrary HTTP requests.\n    - [Apache JMeter](http://jmeter.apache.org/) is a useful tool for establishing concurrent connections to the server.\n\n    This test __fails__ if the server accepts the request and sends back a regular HTTP 200 response.\n\n3. Make sure that the request sent in step 2 did not fail due to an unrelated reason, such as an invalid session.\n    - If in doubt, review server logs to determine the cause of failure. \n    \n    This test __fails__ if the invalid message reaches the application layer or fails for other reasons.",

This header allows browsers to remember that this server requires TLS connection even if a non-secure version is initially requested.\n\n- Specify ***max-age*** to tell the user-agent to cache the domain in the STS list for the number of seconds provided.\n- Add ***includeSubDomains*** to apply the rule to all of the site's subdomains as well.\n\n        Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=1024000; includeSubDomains\n\n- You can also include the ***preload*** directive for your site as another layer of security.\n    - **Note:** Ensure that you understand the implications of using the preload directive. The preload directive submits your domain to Google Chrome's HSTS preload list, which are sites that are hardcoded into Google Chrome as being HTTPS access only. Other browsers use this list too. When your site is included on this list, browsers only view your pages over HTTPS. They will not load your non-secure pages later, even if your server serves HTTP.\n\n**Note:** The browser considers the HSTS header and applies it to further requests only if the server sends it with an HTTPS response to an HTTPS request. The server needs to redirect the first non-HTTP request to the HTTPS page and then return this header.\n\n**Note:** Use this option as an additional security measure, and secure pages containing sensitive data as normal (redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS).\n\n## References\n\n- [Mozilla: HTTP Strict-Transport-Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security)\n- [RFC 6797: HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797)\n",

Hence, if you are storing sensitive information in the clipboard, ensure that you use secure methods (for instance, by masking the sensitive information in the clipboard).",

For example, a web API could allow an IP to have a maximum number of requests within a second, minute, or hour.\n\nYou should also consider using a feature that throttles multiple requests from, or originating from, the same user (API key). This reduces the likelihood of a brute-force attack.\n\nIf a user goes over the maximum number of requests, the throttling mechanism should automatically do one of the following:\n\n- Lock the account or node for a set period.\n- Lock the account or node until it is released by an administrator.\n- Delay the processing of subsequent requests using a suitable algorithm. \n\nYou can use a delay algorithm to increase the time a user has to wait between requests until it becomes inconvenient to continue a brute-force attack. Some web APIs might have short delays of the same interval, but others might increase exponentially. If this user were an attacker inputting random API keys one by one, the delay between the processing of requests would be too long for the attack to be worth the trouble.\n\n__Note__: Refer to this countermeasure's Additional Requirements for more details about Web API throttling types.",

A throttle can be based on the number of requests, size of a payload, or content.\n\n- __IP-level throttling__: Make your API accessible only to white-listed IP addresses, or limit the number of requests sent by a specific client IP.\n\n- __Scope-limit throttling__: Restrict access to specific parts of the API, such as certain methods, functions, or procedures that are based on the users' roles. You can take advantage of the same API across your organization by Implementing scope limiting.\n\n- __Concurrent connections limit__: Limit the number of connections from a user/account to avoid a Denial of Service error when your application cannot respond to more than a certain number of connections.\n\n- __Resource-level throttling__: Use resource-level throttling or hard throttling to limit the number of returned records from your API.\nFor instance, if a certain query returns a large number of records, throttle the request so that your SQL engine limits the number of rows returned by using conditions attributes such as TOP, SKIP, SQL_ATTR_MAX_ROWS, and so on.\n\n- __Tiers of throttling__: Apply throttling at multiple levels in your organization:\n    - API-level throttling\n    - Application-level throttling\n    - User-level throttling\n    - Account-level throttling\n\n## References\n[How to Rate-Limit an API Query](https://www.progress.com/blogs/how-to-rate-limit-an-api-query-throttling-made-easy)",

Classify the data according to its importance to the business, and security risk. If a complete data or asset classification model is in place, list the security requirements for that type of data class. These requirements need to be translated into requirements for the vendor to comply.\n2. Request recent independent evaluations of the vendor's security controls, such as a risk assessment, compliance audit report, or security attestation certificate. Use these sources as inputs for further assessment of the current level of the vendor's risk and its service or solution.\n3. Perform a risk assessment of vendor using a [standard vendor security questionnaire](/library/glossary/G111/) to evaluate the overall level of security and risk. If the risk is low or deemed acceptable, proceed with the vendor selection. If an unacceptable risk is identified or if you are unsure, perform a detailed risk assessment of the vendor solution using a Threat and Risk Assessment (TRA) methodology.\n4. Identify all significant risks, gaps, and vulnerabilities. Rank them based on their likelihood of being exploited, and potential impact.\n5. Work with the vendor directly, or indirectly via the business or procurement function liaising with the vendor, to address all risks identified.\n6. Once all identified risks have been mitigated to an acceptable level, establish [contract clauses](/library/glossary/G110/) to ensure that the vendor will maintain their current level of security (or better) over time, and inform the organization if a data breach is detected or suspected. \n7. Establish standard security clauses to be included in all supplier or vendor agreements. \n8. Document all remaining and residual risks in a risk register, and ensure that they are signed off by a senior business manager. Monitor these risks and review them annually.",

To get a better view into how your application and its components access a user's private data, you should perform data access auditing. \n\nBy registering an instance of `AppOpsManager.OnOpNotedCallback`, we can define what happens when an application component or library dependency accesses a user's sensitive data. The callback is invoked when a user's private data is used by a part of the code (for instance, when getting geolocation updates).\n\nYou can also use attribution tags to better understand which part of an Android application provides a specific type of data access. For applications targeting Android 12 or higher, you should specify attribution tags for the app's components.\n\nTo create attribution tags you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Declare attribution tags in the manifest.\n2. Use attribution tags in your application.\n3. Include attribution tags in access logs.\n\nFor more information about how to perform a data access audit, please refer to Android's [data access audit](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/audit-access) page.",

Also, it's required to establish both a privacy team and a qualified Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT).\n\nAccording to SANS Institute's Incident Handlers Handbook, an incident response consists of 6 steps: \n\n1. Preparation, which includes incident response planning and training to ensure that the incident response team is ready to respond to incidents. \n    - Personnel responsible for responding to suspected and confirmed security incidents are appropriately and periodically trained on their incident response responsibilities.\n2. Identification, which involves the detection of suspicious events that could be security incidents and the collection of evidence. \n3. Containment, which includes short-term containment (e.g., isolating a network segment) and long-term containment (e.g., implementing temporary fixes). \n4. Eradication, where root causes are identified, and mitigation mechanisms are deployed to prevent similar security incidents. \n5. Recovery, which includes bringing back production systems. Decisions around restore time, verification process, and monitoring period also occur at this stage. \n6. Lessons learned, which involves documenting the whole process to identify strengths and weaknesses in the applied procedure.\n\nFinally, ensure that you incorporate industry developments into your security incident response plan periodically.\n\n__Resources__: \n\n- [SANS](https://www.sans.org/white-papers/33901/)\n- [PCI-DSS 4.0](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library/)",

For instructions on how to set up Burpsuite with your browser, see [Burp Suite Setup Guide](/library/glossary/G11/ \"Burp Suite Setup Guide\").\n\n2. Browse all pages, views and actions of the website.\n\n3. In Burpsuite, click on `proxy->history`, and click on the top of the list to open the filter pane.\n\n4. Set the `filter by MIME type` to `HTML` only, and set the filter by extension to hide `js,gif,jpg,png,css`.\n\n5. For each request show in the history being send, perform the all following steps.\n\n6. Select the request to view in the history, right click and send it to `repeater`.\n\n7. Go to `repeater`, select `params` and for each parameter perform the following steps. \n\n8. Change the value of the parameter to the following string and hit \"Go\":\n\n        '';!--\"<XSS>=&{()}\n\n9. Select the `response` and at the bottom of the page, use the search bar and search for the word \"XSS\".\n\n10. If the value `XSS` is not found (e.g. the server returned an error page), you can repeat the test one character at the time. For each test case that the server returns error and does NOT include the original value, you can skip the test to the next test case as the web site is not vulnerable in the specified parameters with the used value.\n\n11. Once you located the string `XSS`, compare the values of the characters in the page with the original values you sent. If the values are escaped properly in the context (e.g. if it is wrapped in single quotes and single quotes are escaped), then the test case passes and you can move to the next test case (or parameter). Otherwise, the site is suspected to be vulnerable to cross site scripting (XSS).\n\n    Note that alternatively, you can right-click on both the original response and the response of the modified paramter, and select \"`Send to comparer`\". Then use the comparer window and click on the `word` button to compare the changes in the response.\n\n12. As an alternative to the test string above, you can change the value of the parameter to the following test cases and hit \"Go\":\n\n        ';alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))\n        //\\';alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))\n        //\";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))\n        //\\\";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))\n        //--></SCRIPT>\">'><SCRIPT>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</SCRIPT>\n\n    Then, in the \"`Response`\" section of the repeater tab, select `render` and see if an alert pops up with the words XSS indicating that the site is vulnerable. (Note that this method is less reliable)\n\n    Note that if there is no limit in the size of the string, all test cases can be merged into one long string and tested in one shot.\n\nNOTE: More test cases [can be found here](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet).",

Untrusted data may cause problems not only in  HTML output but also in dynamically generated JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), or Adobe Flash components.\n\nAttackers can use this weakness to inject specially-crafted scripts into your application in order to:\n\n- Transfer private data to the attacker, such as cookies and session information.\n- Send malicious requests to a website on behalf of the victim, which is especially dangerous if the victim has administrator privileges for that site.\n- Perform phishing attacks to emulate trusted websites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that website.\n- Utilize the script to exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself, with the potential to take over a victim's machine. This is sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\" \n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim being aware of it.

                    "text": "Use Java Encoder functions in your application to escape untrusted data by following these steps:\n\n1. [Download the encoder's JAR file(s)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_Encoder_Project) and add them to the project libraries.\n\n2. Import the Encode class:\n\n    - For example, `import org.owasp.encoder.Encode;` in Java, or\n    - `<%@ page import = \"org.OWASP.encoder.Encode\" %>` in JSP.\n\n3. Use the Encode class as described in the [project's page](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_Encoder_Project#tab=Use_the_Java_Encoder_Project). The following example in JSP receives a query parameter as _input_ and shows the same text in various contexts after encoding. That is, if the input is null, it replaces it with a malicious string:\n\n        <%@page contentType=\"text/html\" pageEncoding=\"UTF-8\"%>\n        <%@ page import=\"org.owasp.encoder.Encode\" %>\n        <!DOCTYPE html>\n        <html>\n        <body>\n        <%  String a=request.getParameter(\"input\"); \n        if (a==null) a=\"\\\"><script>window.alert(\\\"Hello!\\\")</script>\";  %>\n        <br/> This is the output of Encode.forHtml():\n        <%= Encode.forHtml(a) %>\n        <br/> This is the output of Encode.forHtmlAttribute():\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"address\" value=\"<%= Encode.forHtmlAttribute(a) %>\" />\n        <br/> This is the output of Encode.forHtmlContent():\n        <textarea name=\"text\"><%= Encode.forHtmlContent(a) %></textarea>\n        <br/> Input data without encoding:         \n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"address\" value=\"<%= a%>\"/>\n        </body>\n        </html>\n\n4. Right-click on the rendered web page in your browser, and choose the option to view the source of the page. The page source can let you see how the same string is encoded for different contexts. For example, in Chrome, click on the 'View page source' option, or press Ctrl-U.\n\n5. Always put attributes __within quotation marks (\" \")__:\n\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"address\" value=\"<%= Encode.forHtmlAttribute(a) %>\" />\n\n    The following example shows missing quotation marks for the HTML attribute:\n\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"address\" value=<%= Encode.forHtmlAttribute(a) %> />\n\n6. Use the right function for the right context:\n\n    - For example, distinguish between `Encode.forHtmlAttribute()` and `Encode.forHtmlContent()`.\n    - `Encode.forHtmlContent()` is used for unquoted HTML text content.\n\n\n\n## Resources\n\nFor more information about deploying the Java Encoder Project, click [here](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_Encoder_Project#tab=Deploy_the_Java_Encoder_Project).\n\nFor more information about using the Java Encoder Project in other contexts, click [here](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_Encoder_Project#tab=Use_the_Java_Encoder_Project).\n\nFor the Java Encoder Project's source code, click [here](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-java-encoder).\n",

For example, double quotes are encoded as `&#39;`, which is one byte shorter than `&quot;`. You can use it on HTML pages with UTF-8 or UTF-16 character encoding in the meta tags and HTTP headers.\n\nUse the following code samples in your code for creating your HTML interfaces. In each of these samples, **\"UntrustedOutput\"** represents the text that you want to encode.\n\nNotice that \"UntrustedOutput\" is wrapped in a variable, which adds the encoding to your HTML code dynamically whenever it is generated.\n\n##Deployment and Use\nFor information on how to deploy Java Encoder see the [OWASP Java Encoder Wiki](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-java-encoder/wiki/1\\)-Deploy-The-OWASP-Java-Encoder).\nAfter you add the .jar file, you can import the classes and use them in the application. For example, the following code snippet provides a JSP sample that imports the `Encode` class and uses its functions:\n```\n<%@page contentType=\"text/html\" pageEncoding=\"UTF-8\"%>\n<%@ page import=\"org.owasp.encoder.Encode\" %>\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n    <body>\n         <%  String a=request.getParameter(\"input\");  %>\n         <br/> This is the output of Encode.forHtml():\n         <%= Encode.forHtml(a) %>\n         <br/> This is the output of Encode.forHtmlAttribute():\n         <input type=\"text\" name=\"address\" value=\"<%= Encode.forHtmlAttribute(a) %>\" />\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n##Contextual HTML Encoding\n\n###Encoding HTML\nUse this function to encode HTML markup. It can be used instead of `forHTMLAttribute` and `forHTMLContent` for content and attributes, respectively. These methods are introduced below. It is, however, unsafe to use it in *unquoted attributes* (it can be technically used with attributes if they are rigorously quoted).\n\nIn the case of unquoted attributes, use `forHTMLUnquotedAttribute` because unquoted attributes can be broken out of with many characters such as % <=> + - * , ; / | ^ and [space].\n```\n<body><%= Encode.forHtml(UntrustedOutput) %></body>\n```\n###Encoding HTML Text\nUse this function to encode text that will appear in an HTML document (not tags). This text could be from a source such as an input field, or text that goes inside of the `<p>` tag, for example.\n```\n<textarea name=\"text\"><%= Encode.forHtmlContent(UntrustedOutput) %></textarea>\n```\n###Encoding HTML Attributes\nUse this function to encode HTML attributes. Be sure to quote them at all times.\n```\n<input type=\"text\" name=\"address\" value=\"<%= Encode.forHtmlAttribute(UntrustedOutput) %>\" />\n```\n###Encoding CSS\nUse this function to encode entries that will appear in your CSS stylesheet.\n```\n<div style=\"width:<= Encode.forCssString(UntrustedOutput) %>\">\n<div style=\"background:<= Encode.forCssUrl(UntrustedOutput) %>\">\n```\n\n###Encoding JavaScript Blocks\nUse this function to encode entire blocks of JavaScript code.\n```\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var msg = \"<%= Encode.forJavaScriptBlock(UntrustedOutput) %>\";\n  alert(msg);\n</script>\n```\n\n###Encoding JavaScript Variables\nUse this function to encode inline JavaScript event attributes.\n```\n<button onclick=\"alert('<%= Encode.forJavaScriptAttribute(UntrustedOutput) %>');\">\n  click me\n</button>\n```\n\n###Encoding Untrusted URLs\nUse this function to encode an untrusted URL. This might be a URL that was submitted through a comment or posting form, for example. \n```\n//First we verify that the URL is a legal URL.\nString url = validateURL(untrustedInput);\n\n/*\nThen we encode it to appear as an HTML attribute on the page.\nIf there's any link text enclosed by the \"a\" tag, we encode it using forHtmlContent.\n*/\n<a href=\"<%= Encode.forHtmlAttribute(untrustedUrl) %>\">\n  <%= Encode.forHtmlContent(untrustedLinkName) %>\n</a>\n```\n###Encoding URL Parameters\nUse this function to encode URL parameters.\n```\n<a href=\"/search?value=<%= Encode.forUriComponent(UntrustedOutput) %>&order=1#top\">\n```\n\n###Encoding REST URL Parameters\nUse this function to encode REST URL parameters.\n```\n<a href=\"/page/<%= Encode.forUriComponent(UntrustedOutput) %>\">\n```\n\nFor more information, see the GitHub page for the [OWASP Java Encoder Project](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-java-encoder/wiki/).",

                    "text": "Use the [OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer](https://github.com/owasp/java-html-sanitizer) to sanitize your output. It takes in HTML and runs it through policies that you create to decide what is allowed and what is not. HTML Sanitizer sanitizes HTML by simply throwing out all embedded JavaScript code. You can, however, allow a safe and signed JavaScript code by using custom element/attribute (for further information please see the Java documentation on [HTMLPolicyBuilder class](http://static.javadoc.io/com.googlecode.owasp-java-html-sanitizer/owasp-java-html-sanitizer/20160924.1/org/owasp/html/HtmlPolicyBuilder.html)).\n\nFor handling third-party JavaScript, you can learn more by seeing the [Caja Project](https://developers.google.com/caja/). Moreover, HTML Sanitizer is not focused on parsing and sanitizing CSS. Instead, it offers a single styling option allowing textual styling. This option, however, is strongly restricted and does not allow for loading images, breaking the layout, and so on.\n\nFirst, we create a policy using the `HtmlPolicyBuilder` class, located at `org.owasp.html.HtmlPolicyBuilder`.\nThe `.allow` methods activate tags, attributes or processing modes that we want to allow in our HTML output. \nIn this example, we are allowing hyperlinks (`a`) and paragraphs (`p`) in the `.allowElements` method.\nThe `.allowAttributes` method allows the `href` attribute to be used for hyperlinks; the `onElements` method indicates that the element in which **href** will be allowed is `a`, for hyperlinks. The `.toFactory` method sends the configuration to be built.\n```\nfunction<HtmlStreamEventReceiver, HtmlSanitizer.Policy> policy\n     = new HtmlPolicyBuilder()\n         .allowElements(\"a\", \"p\")\n         .allowAttributes(\"href\").onElements(\"a\")\n         .toFactory();\n```\nNext, we sanitize the input by sending our HTML code to the `HtmlSanitizer` class.\n```\nHtmlSanitizer.sanitize(myHtml, policy.apply(myHtmlStreamRenderer));\n```\n\nHere is another way to configure a policy. Notice how the `.allowElement` method is different from the other policy we looked at before. \n\nThis example converts headers into the `<div>` tag using the `apply()` method from the element policy within the `.allowElement` method. The `.build` method is similar to the `.toFactory` method in the previous example: it sends the configuration to be built.\n```\nnew HtmlPolicyBuilder()\n   .allowElement(\n     new ElementPolicy() {\n       public String apply(String elementName, List<String> attributes) {\n         attributes.add(\"class\");\n         attributes.add(\"header-\" + elementName);\n         return \"div\";\n       }\n     },\n     \"h1\", \"h2\", \"h3\", \"h4\", \"h5\", \"h6\")\n   .build(outputChannel)\n```",

For example, we have different escape syntaxes for HTML entities, HTML attributes, CSS, and JavaScript.\n    - For escaping, use a security-focused encoding library to make sure escaping rules are properly implemented.\n    - Many web application frameworks provide automatic contextual escaping functionality; use these technologies when you can.\n    - **HTML error messages** are another example of untrusted data. Encode them as well before displaying them on a webpage if they might contain any user-controllable data.\n\nFor reference, review these encoding libraries:\n\n- [OWASP Enterprise Security API](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API) is a library that provides encoders for data in different forms, including HTML, HTML attributes, CSS, and JavaScript. \n- The [OWASP Java Encoder Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_Encoder_Project) provides a reference for encoding output in Java.\n- Microsoft provides an encoding library named [Microsoft Anti-Cross Site Scripting Library](http://wpl.codeplex.com/) for the .NET platform.\n- ASP.NET Framework has a built-in [ValidateRequest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms972969.aspx#securitybarriers_topic6) function that provides limited sanitization.",

External user input can be anything like:\n     - Command-line parameters.\n     - Form fields for Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications.\n     - Environment variables.\n     - Interprocess communication, such as shared memory, and named pipes.\n     - Content from a file that can be modified by end users or other programs.\n     - The output of another web app or web service\n\n- **Validate** all function input. \n    - Confirm that all strings are checked for text or data that can be erroneously or maliciously interpreted as a command (rejects such inputs or otherwise handles such inputs securely)\n    - Reject or otherwise securely handle any inputs that violate buffer size or other memory allocation thresholds, for functions that handle buffers and process data.\n\n- Use **allowlist validation** where possible.\n    - Allowlists limit input to a specific set of values and refuse all others.\n\n- Use **blocklist validation** when allowlists are not possible.\n    - Blocklists filter out values known to be dangerous.\n\n- Use **output encoding**.\n    - This converts the input to a safe format to reduce the risk of injection attacks.\n\n- Use **logging**.\n    - Log the input validation failures that result in request rejection.\n\nInput validation can happen on different levels. For example, we may have:\n\n- Character level validation:\n    - This removes potentially risky characters from the input. \n\n- Keyword level validation:\n    - This checks that the value of input keywords:\n        - Have a specific **data type**\n        - Fall within a **valid range**\n        - Are **consistent** with other existing or provided values\n        - Are **structured** properly\n        - And so on.",

Logging actions does not necessarily enable non-repudiation either, because it cannot eliminate the possibility of denial in the future.",

An example of a critical function is authentication to critical subsystems.\n\n- **Identify** critical features and services that, if abused, may have significant consequences, such as the pursuit of legal action.\n\n- **Display** (or send) messages that include the following notes (whichever applicable) when these features are accessed:\n\n     - The user is about to utilize an important service.\n     - This part of the system may be subject to audit and recorded.\n     - By using the system, the user gives his/her consent to being monitored by the system.\n     - Users are responsible for their actions and may be prosecuted in the case of abuse or misuse of the system.\n     - Users are accessing a government information system.\n\n- Do not allow further access to the system until the user acknowledges receipt of the notification message, and agrees to the usage conditions by an **explicit action**, such as clicking on an acknowledgment button.\n\n- For **publicly accessible systems** display:\n\n    - System use conditions, before granting further access.\n    - References, if any, to indicated consistency of the auditing process with privacy policies for the system.\n    - A description of the authorized system usage.\n\n __Note__: While these warnings demonstrate that due care is exercised in product design, limit the liability of product designers, and help in case of legal prosecution, they can practically reduce the number of hacking or misuse attempts. The warnings dissuade opportunists from further experimenting with the system when they realize that the system is monitored and supervised.\n\n__Note__: System use notifications are not required for **access via non-human logon interfaces**.",

An example of this is a perpetrator creating records and sending or receiving messages without being traced.\n\nTwo types of weaknesses can be considered under this title:\n\n 1. **Failure to prove intention**\n\n    - For the purpose of legal prosecution, users should receive enough information about their actions and responsibilities in the form of on-screen messages.\n    - This is also useful for proving that violators harmed a system intentionally despite receiving information about the consequences of their actions.\n\nWithout these messages, violators assume that their activities are not monitored, or that they are not responsible for their actions.\n\n2. **Failure to prove involvement or achieve non-repudiation**\n\n    - Without the mechanisms to achieve accountability and non-repudiation, perpetrators can deny their involvement in their actions.\n    - Additionally, if a system cannot uniquely identify its users, it is not possible to hold individuals responsible for their actions.\n\nThis is commonly seen when two or more users use the same set of credentials. Logging actions does not necessarily enable non-repudiation either, because it cannot eliminate the possibility of denial in the future.",

For example, an organization might cease to provide cybersecurity support for a product, yet it can continue to operate as intended. While both decommissioning and terminating cybersecurity support can lead to cybersecurity concerns, these issues are evaluated independently. \n\nTo perform the two processes adequately, you should:\n\n\n- Create a procedure to communicate to customers when your organization plans to terminate cybersecurity support for an item or component. The procedure can be communicated under contract requirements or announcements.\n\n- Make available cybersecurity requirements for post-development with regard to decommissioning, using appropriate documentation (for example, instructions or user manuals).",

                "description": "Follow these guidelines to secure use of in-app billing services:\n\n1. ___Verify the signature provided with the response on the server:___ Google play's Developer Console, assigns an asymmetric key pair to each application (The private key will always remain with Google. You can see the application's public key through Developer Console application's details -> Services & APIs -> License Key. Read ['Securing Your Application'](http://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_integrate.html#billing-security) for more detail). Google Play signs the response string (in JSON format) that is sent to your application. You need to send the signature along with the data to the server (if the application has a server component) to check the signature on the server and take the next steps only if the signature is valid (see the `verify()` method in `Security.java` that is shipped as sample (TrivialDrive) with `IInAppBillingService.aidl` and SDK package from Google. Change the function to do the verification on the server if possible).\n\n2. ___Use a secure channel with a reliable handshake:___ Use a secure channel between the application and the server. For example, use a secure TLS/SSL channel.\n\n3. ___Make the purchased items uniquely available to the application:___ Do not put the purchasable items and content in the APK file without proper security protection. It is recommended to put them on the server and download them to the application only after they are purchased. After you copy the content to the client, use an application-specific method to encrypt the content and save them on storage. For example use the UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) of the application with a key to encrypt data.\n\n4. ___Verify the Order Id and the Developer Payload values:___ You provide a developer payload value with your request. When the response is returned to the application the payload value (developerPayload argument) and the unique ID of the order (orderID argument) are sent to your application (see the [In-app Billing Reference](http://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_reference.html)). Verify these values along with the signature (on the server). \n\n5. Use secure random generators (`SecureRandom`) if you generate a random number for parts or whole of developerPayload. \n\n6. ___Obfuscate your application and protect the keys:___ Android documents recommend obfuscating the application. However note that any obfuscation method can be reversed, so while using this method do not solely rely on obfuscation. See this section on [obfuscating the code](http://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_best_practices.html#obfuscate) and [ProGuard page](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/proguard.html). Also do not hard-code the public key in the application or leave it unprotected. If you check the signature on the server, you will not need the public key saved on the client.\n\n7. ___Design and implement a scheme for disabling content:___ Design and implement means to disable any content that is purchased but revoked for any security or piracy reasons afterwards.\n\nRead [this page](http://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_best_practices.html) along with the above recommendations before starting to secure in-app-purchases in your application.",

Verify that a secure channel with a secure handshake (such as TLS/SSL) is used between the application and the server.\n\n3. Verify that the content (which is enabled through a purchase) is not in the APK in a way that hackers can access the files and copy them to any other packages.\n    - Verify that the content is encrypted when moved to the client from the server. If possible, the encrypted content should be application-specific, in a way that does not allow its use on other devices and applications.\n    - Verify that a unique element of the application is used to encrypt the content (such as a Universal Unique Identifier, UUID)\n\n4. Check that Order ID and Developer Payload values are verified against the request values.\n\n5. Verify that secure random generators (`SecureRandom`) are used to generate random numbers for Developer Payloads. \n\n6. Verify that the code is obfuscated.\n\n7.

Provide security guidance to all stakeholders involved in software installation and configuration. Train and direct all stakeholders through the deployment and configuration of the software, especially for new software. Ensure that your guidance and training include all [key components for pre-installation training](/library/glossary/G87/).\n2. Document and consistently follow [software installation and configuration planning best practices](/library/glossary/G89/). \n3. Ensure that development and operations are aligned on the project install and configuration timelines. Operations must be informed of infrastructure changes in advance, as well as how to best monitor the application and early warning signs of weaknesses to be alerted to.\n4. Automate software deployment whenever possible. Utilize a build server to automate the process or a script that copies files across the network - avoid manual installations and make them repeatable to eliminate the possibility of skipping manual steps.\n5. Minimize the amount of change and introduce small changes in each software update if possible. If a weakness is identified , it is easier to roll back those changes or to know what the source of the weakness may be. Each release takes an effort in planning and testing - establish the right balance of frequency and size of releases that is optimal for the organization to handle.\n6. Create a test plan for the application login page, key pages within the application, APIs, etc. Execute on the test plan and document results for future reference.\n7. Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) or metrics to know if the application is running as expected. [Performance and capacity metrics](/library/glossary/G88/) will vary between applications. Monitor metrics and KPIs at all times.\n8. Execute [post-implementation checks](/library/glossary/G90/) after deployment.",

An attacker can exploit this if you use the downloaded data without sufficiently verifying its origin, integrity, and size.\n\nAttackers can execute malicious code by compromising the host server, performing DNS spoofing, or modifying the code or data in transit. Attackers can also cause a denial of service attack by feeding your application with large bulks of data.\n\nThe risk is especially higher when the downloaded data resides on shared resources that are accessible to other applications, or when they are transferred over an unsecured network. For example, files are at risk when they are stored in the shared external storage of a mobile device.\n\nUsing third-party servers, for example, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to host files such as Javascript libraries and CSS stylesheets that are shared among multiple sites can also increase the risk of the remote content being manipulated by attackers. CDNs can improve site performance and conserve bandwidth; however, using third-party hosted content comes with a risk, in that if an attacker gains control of the third-party server, the attacker can inject arbitrary malicious content into files (or replace the files completely) and thus can also potentially attack all sites that fetch files from that third-party content provider.",

Furthermore, your policy should establish clear cybersecurity objectives that your organization intends to achieve.\n\nYour policy must:\n\n- Define rules and processes to support the mitigation of cybersecurity threats and risks. These rules and processes should cover various phases such as conceptualization, product development, production, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning, and should include techniques such as TARA methods, information sharing, cybersecurity monitoring, and cybersecurity incident response. \n\n- Assign and communicate roles and responsibilities to achieve and maintain cybersecurity. Ensure that personnel assigned to cybersecurity roles have competence, awareness, and training regarding known attack methods, cybersecurity controls, functional safety, and privacy. \n\n- Allocate resources (for example tools and personnel) to address cybersecurity issues. \n\n- Include a cybersecurity Continuous Improvement process for your organization. In your CI process, leverage past experiences, similar applications in the field, and cybersecurity-related information from internal and external sources with the goal of keeping your cybersecurity posture up to date. \n\n- Specify the circumstances where sharing cybersecurity-related information is necessary, authorized, or restricted, either within or outside the organization. \n\n- Employ a quality management system. Your quality management system should address issues such as change management, documentation management, configuration management, and requirements management. \n\n- Ensure that the information (for example documentation and configurations) needed to maintain the cybersecurity of your product is accessible until the end of the cybersecurity support for that product. Furthermore, ensure that you take the necessary steps that allow you to reproduce the environment required to remediate cybersecurity incidents for any particular product until the end of that product's cybersecurity support.\n\n- Employ a cybersecurity management system. \n\n- Enforce the management of tools (for example programming tools, static checkers, verification tools, and flash writers) that can affect the cybersecurity of the product. To ensure the proper management of your tools, you can employ methods such as access control and authentication. Additionally, ensure that your work products such as produced software are stored on a secure file server and are protected against unauthorized access. \n\n- Enforce security audits to ensure that your organization complies with required cybersecurity regulations and standards.",

                "text": "HTTP specifies many different methods (or verbs), such as GET, POST, HEAD, PUT. Web applications generally use GET and POST methods exclusively for requests.\n\nMany web applications will limit which HTTP verbs can be used to access a resource (most likely GET or POST) by defining a security constraint within web.xml and explicitly listing GET and POST within separate <http-method> tags.\n\nThe HTTP HEAD method works like a GET method, except that the server must not return a message body in the response [1]. The HTTP specification intended that GET requests (along with HEAD) \"should not have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval.\" That is, GET requests should not change the state of the application&mdash;they should be indempotent.\n\nMany applications define non-idempotent GET requests. They treat GET requests like POST requests that can execute transactions that change the state of the application. An example of such a URL would be: www.myapp.org/mgmt/accts.jsp?q=delAcct.\n\nAs a result, an attacker could attempt to trap the above GET request in an HTTP proxy, modify it to a HEAD request, and submit the request. Since HEAD is not one of the HTTP methods listed in web.xml, the authorization check would be bypassed and the code that processes GET requests may be executed. This is called an HTTP Verb Tampering attack.\n\nFurthermore, some frameworks, such as Java EE, allow the use of arbitrary HTTP verbs. An attacker can send a \"BOB\" request rather than HEAD, and since it is not listed in the security constraint, the constraint will be bypassed. Arbitrary verbs will not work when accessing a Servlet, but are acceptable if the request targets a JSP directly. This is because when a JSP is compiled its components are sent to a service() method, rather than the doGet() or doPost() methods of a Servlet. Therefore, any arbitrary verb that is submitted will be directed to the service() method.\n\n[1] HTTP/1.1: Method Definitions - [http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html)",
