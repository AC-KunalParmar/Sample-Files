The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT\nIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching\nalgorithms.\n\nSuch OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure\nAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify\nwhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or\ndecrypt, or digest passed data.\n\nApplications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are\naffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose\nof display, the severity is considered low.\n\nIn OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,\nCMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way\nthat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered\nnot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,\nand the severity is therefore considered low.",

            "help": "# Bad HTML filtering regexp\nIt is possible to match some single HTML tags using regular expressions (parsing general HTML using regular expressions is impossible). However, if the regular expression is not written well it might be possible to circumvent it, which can lead to cross-site scripting or other security issues.\n\nSome of these mistakes are caused by browsers having very forgiving HTML parsers, and will often render invalid HTML containing syntax errors. Regular expressions that attempt to match HTML should also recognize tags containing such syntax errors.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a well-tested sanitization or parser library if at all possible. These libraries are much more likely to handle corner cases correctly than a custom implementation.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example attempts to filters out all `<script>` tags.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction filterScript(html) {\n    var scriptRegex = /<script\\b[^>]*>([\\s\\S]*?)<\\/script>/gi;\n    var match;\n    while ((match = scriptRegex.exec(html)) !== null) {\n        html = html.replace(match[0], match[1]);\n    }\n    return html;\n}\n\n```\nThe above sanitizer does not filter out all `<script>` tags. Browsers will not only accept `</script>` as script end tags, but also tags such as `</script foo=\"bar\">` even though it is a parser error. This means that an attack string such as `<script>alert(1)</script foo=\"bar\">` will not be filtered by the function, and `alert(1)` will be executed by a browser if the string is rendered as HTML.\n\nOther corner cases include that HTML comments can end with `--!>`, and that HTML tag names can contain upper case characters.\n\n\n## References\n* Securitum: [The Curious Case of Copy &amp; Paste](https://research.securitum.com/the-curious-case-of-copy-paste/).\n* stackoverflow.com: [You can't parse \\[X\\]HTML with regex](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags#answer-1732454).\n* HTML Standard: [Comment end bang state](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#comment-end-bang-state).\n* stackoverflow.com: [Why aren't browsers strict about HTML?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25559999/why-arent-browsers-strict-about-html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-80](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-184](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/184.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-185](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/185.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-186](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/186.html).\n",

            "help": "# XML internal entity expansion\nParsing untrusted XML files with a weakly configured XML parser may be vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks exploiting uncontrolled internal entity expansion.\n\nIn XML, so-called *internal entities* are a mechanism for introducing an abbreviation for a piece of text or part of a document. When a parser that has been configured to expand entities encounters a reference to an internal entity, it replaces the entity by the data it represents. The replacement text may itself contain other entity references, which are expanded recursively. This means that entity expansion can increase document size dramatically.\n\nIf untrusted XML is parsed with entity expansion enabled, a malicious attacker could submit a document that contains very deeply nested entity definitions, causing the parser to take a very long time or use large amounts of memory. This is sometimes called an *XML bomb* attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nThe safest way to prevent XML bomb attacks is to disable entity expansion when parsing untrusted data. How this is done depends on the library being used. Note that some libraries, such as recent versions of `libxmljs` (though not its SAX parser API), disable entity expansion by default, so unless you have explicitly enabled entity expansion, no further action is needed.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example uses the XML parser provided by the `node-expat` package to parse a string `xmlSrc`. If that string is from an untrusted source, this code may be vulnerable to a DoS attack, since `node-expat` expands internal entities by default:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n  expat = require(\"node-expat\");\n\napp.post(\"upload\", (req, res) => {\n  let xmlSrc = req.body,\n    parser = new expat.Parser();\n  parser.on(\"startElement\", handleStart);\n  parser.on(\"text\", handleText);\n  parser.write(xmlSrc);\n});\n\n```\nAt the time of writing, `node-expat` does not provide a way of controlling entity expansion, but the example could be rewritten to use the `sax` package instead, which only expands standard entities such as `&amp;`:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n  sax = require(\"sax\");\n\napp.post(\"upload\", (req, res) => {\n  let xmlSrc = req.body,\n    parser = sax.parser(true);\n  parser.onopentag = handleStart;\n  parser.ontext = handleText;\n  parser.write(xmlSrc);\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [Billion Laughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs).\n* Bryan Sullivan: [Security Briefs - XML Denial of Service Attacks and Defenses](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee335713.aspx).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-776](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/776.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n",

            "help": "# XML external entity expansion\nParsing untrusted XML files with a weakly configured XML parser may lead to an XML External Entity (XXE) attack. This type of attack uses external entity references to access arbitrary files on a system, carry out denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, or server-side request forgery. Even when the result of parsing is not returned to the user, DoS attacks are still possible and out-of-band data retrieval techniques may allow attackers to steal sensitive data.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nThe easiest way to prevent XXE attacks is to disable external entity handling when parsing untrusted data. How this is done depends on the library being used. Note that some libraries, such as recent versions of `libxml`, disable entity expansion by default, so unless you have explicitly enabled entity expansion, no further action needs to be taken.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example uses the `libxml` XML parser to parse a string `xmlSrc`. If that string is from an untrusted source, this code may be vulnerable to an XXE attack, since the parser is invoked with the `noent` option set to `true`:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n  libxml = require(\"libxmljs\");\n\napp.post(\"upload\", (req, res) => {\n  let xmlSrc = req.body,\n    doc = libxml.parseXml(xmlSrc, { noent: true });\n});\n\n```\nTo guard against XXE attacks, the `noent` option should be omitted or set to `false`. This means that no entity expansion is undertaken at all, not even for standard internal entities such as `&amp;` or `&gt;`. If desired, these entities can be expanded in a separate step using utility functions provided by libraries such as [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/#unescape), [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#unescape) or [he](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/he).\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n  libxml = require(\"libxmljs\");\n\napp.post(\"upload\", (req, res) => {\n  let xmlSrc = req.body,\n    doc = libxml.parseXml(xmlSrc);\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [XML External Entity (XXE) Processing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing).\n* Timothy Morgen: [XML Schema, DTD, and Entity Attacks](https://research.nccgroup.com/2014/05/19/xml-schema-dtd-and-entity-attacks-a-compendium-of-known-techniques/).\n* Timur Yunusov, Alexey Osipov: [XML Out-Of-Band Data Retrieval](https://www.slideshare.net/qqlan/bh-ready-v4).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-611](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-827](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/827.html).\n",

            "help": "# Uncontrolled data used in path expression\nAccessing files using paths constructed from user-controlled data can allow an attacker to access unexpected resources. This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or an attacker being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected files.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nValidate user input before using it to construct a file path, either using an off-the-shelf library like the `sanitize-filename` npm package, or by performing custom validation.\n\nIdeally, follow these rules:\n\n* Do not allow more than a single \".\" character.\n* Do not allow directory separators such as \"/\" or \"\\\\\" (depending on the file system).\n* Do not rely on simply replacing problematic sequences such as \"../\". For example, after applying this filter to \".../...//\", the resulting string would still be \"../\".\n* Use a whitelist of known good patterns.\n\n## Example\nIn the first example, a file name is read from an HTTP request and then used to access a file. However, a malicious user could enter a file name which is an absolute path, such as `\"/etc/passwd\"`.\n\nIn the second example, it appears that the user is restricted to opening a file within the `\"user\"` home directory. However, a malicious user could enter a file name containing special characters. For example, the string `\"../../etc/passwd\"` will result in the code reading the file located at `\"/home/user/../../etc/passwd\"`, which is the system's password file. This file would then be sent back to the user, giving them access to all the system's passwords.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar fs = require('fs'),\n    http = require('http'),\n    url = require('url');\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  let path = url.parse(req.url, true).query.path;\n\n  // BAD: This could read any file on the file system\n  res.write(fs.readFileSync(path));\n\n  // BAD: This could still read any file on the file system\n  res.write(fs.readFileSync(\"/home/user/\" + path));\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal).\n* npm: [sanitize-filename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-filename) package.\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-36](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-73](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-99](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/99.html).\n",

This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or an attacker being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected files.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nValidate user input before using it to construct a file path, either using an off-the-shelf library like the `sanitize-filename` npm package, or by performing custom validation.\n\nIdeally, follow these rules:\n\n* Do not allow more than a single \".\" character.\n* Do not allow directory separators such as \"/\" or \"\\\\\" (depending on the file system).\n* Do not rely on simply replacing problematic sequences such as \"../\". For example, after applying this filter to \".../...//\", the resulting string would still be \"../\".\n* Use a whitelist of known good patterns.\n\n## Example\nIn the first example, a file name is read from an HTTP request and then used to access a file. However, a malicious user could enter a file name which is an absolute path, such as `\"/etc/passwd\"`.\n\nIn the second example, it appears that the user is restricted to opening a file within the `\"user\"` home directory. However, a malicious user could enter a file name containing special characters. For example, the string `\"../../etc/passwd\"` will result in the code reading the file located at `\"/home/user/../../etc/passwd\"`, which is the system's password file. This file would then be sent back to the user, giving them access to all the system's passwords.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar fs = require('fs'),\n    http = require('http'),\n    url = require('url');\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  let path = url.parse(req.url, true).query.path;\n\n  // BAD: This could read any file on the file system\n  res.write(fs.readFileSync(path));\n\n  // BAD: This could still read any file on the file system\n  res.write(fs.readFileSync(\"/home/user/\" + path));\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal).\n* npm: [sanitize-filename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-filename) package.\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-36](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-73](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-99](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/99.html).\n",

            "help": "# XML internal entity expansion\nParsing untrusted XML files with a weakly configured XML parser may be vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks exploiting uncontrolled internal entity expansion.\n\nIn XML, so-called *internal entities* are a mechanism for introducing an abbreviation for a piece of text or part of a document. When a parser that has been configured to expand entities encounters a reference to an internal entity, it replaces the entity by the data it represents. The replacement text may itself contain other entity references, which are expanded recursively. This means that entity expansion can increase document size dramatically.\n\nIf untrusted XML is parsed with entity expansion enabled, a malicious attacker could submit a document that contains very deeply nested entity definitions, causing the parser to take a very long time or use large amounts of memory. This is sometimes called an *XML bomb* attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nThe safest way to prevent XML bomb attacks is to disable entity expansion when parsing untrusted data. How this is done depends on the library being used. Note that some libraries, such as recent versions of `libxmljs` (though not its SAX parser API), disable entity expansion by default, so unless you have explicitly enabled entity expansion, no further action is needed.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example uses the XML parser provided by the `node-expat` package to parse a string `xmlSrc`. If that string is from an untrusted source, this code may be vulnerable to a DoS attack, since `node-expat` expands internal entities by default:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n  expat = require(\"node-expat\");\n\napp.post(\"upload\", (req, res) => {\n  let xmlSrc = req.body,\n    parser = new expat.Parser();\n  parser.on(\"startElement\", handleStart);\n  parser.on(\"text\", handleText);\n  parser.write(xmlSrc);\n});\n\n```\nAt the time of writing, `node-expat` does not provide a way of controlling entity expansion, but the example could be rewritten to use the `sax` package instead, which only expands standard entities such as `&amp;`:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n  sax = require(\"sax\");\n\napp.post(\"upload\", (req, res) => {\n  let xmlSrc = req.body,\n    parser = sax.parser(true);\n  parser.onopentag = handleStart;\n  parser.ontext = handleText;\n  parser.write(xmlSrc);\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [Billion Laughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs).\n* Bryan Sullivan: [Security Briefs - XML Denial of Service Attacks and Defenses](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee335713.aspx).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-776](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/776.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n",

This leaves the website vulnerable to cross-site scripting.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar app = require('express')();\n\napp.get('/user/:id', function(req, res) {\n  if (!isValidUserId(req.params.id))\n    // BAD: a request parameter is incorporated without validation into the response\n    res.send(\"Unknown user: \" + req.params.id);\n  else\n    // TODO: do something exciting\n    ;\n});\n\n```\nSanitizing the user-controlled data prevents the vulnerability:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar escape = require('escape-html');\n\nvar app = require('express')();\n\napp.get('/user/:id', function(req, res) {\n  if (!isValidUserId(req.params.id))\n    // GOOD: request parameter is sanitized before incorporating it into the response\n    res.send(\"Unknown user: \" + escape(req.params.id));\n  else\n    // TODO: do something exciting\n    ;\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP [Types of Cross-Site Scripting](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).\n* Wikipedia: [Cross-site scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n",

For example, the input `{'<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>': 'foo'}` will generate the error `data/<img src=x onerror=alert(1)> should be number`, causing reflected XSS.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP: [XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP [DOM Based XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/DOM_Based_XSS).\n* OWASP [Types of Cross-Site Scripting](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).\n* Wikipedia: [Cross-site scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n",

            "help": "# Code injection\nDirectly evaluating user input (for example, an HTTP request parameter) as code without properly sanitizing the input first allows an attacker arbitrary code execution. This can occur when user input is treated as JavaScript, or passed to a framework which interprets it as an expression to be evaluated. Examples include AngularJS expressions or JQuery selectors.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nAvoid including user input in any expression which may be dynamically evaluated. If user input must be included, use context-specific escaping before including it. It is important that the correct escaping is used for the type of evaluation that will occur.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows part of the page URL being evaluated as JavaScript code. This allows an attacker to provide JavaScript within the URL. If an attacker can persuade a user to click on a link to such a URL, the attacker can evaluate arbitrary JavaScript in the browser of the user to, for example, steal cookies containing session information.\n\n\n```javascript\neval(document.location.href.substring(document.location.href.indexOf(\"default=\")+8))\n\n```\nThe following example shows a Pug template being constructed from user input, allowing attackers to run arbitrary code via a payload such as `#{global.process.exit(1)}`.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express')\nvar pug = require('pug');\nconst app = express()\n\napp.post('/', (req, res) => {\n    var input = req.query.username;\n    var template = `\ndoctype\nhtml\nhead\n    title= 'Hello world'\nbody\n    form(action='/' method='post')\n        input#name.form-control(type='text)\n        button.btn.btn-primary(type='submit') Submit\n    p Hello `+ input\n    var fn = pug.compile(template);\n    var html = fn();\n    res.send(html);\n})\n\n```\nBelow is an example of how to use a template engine without any risk of template injection. The user input is included via an interpolation expression `#{username}` whose value is provided as an option to the template, instead of being part of the template string itself:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express')\nvar pug = require('pug');\nconst app = express()\n\napp.post('/', (req, res) => {\n    var input = req.query.username;\n    var template = `\ndoctype\nhtml\nhead\n    title= 'Hello world'\nbody\n    form(action='/' method='post')\n        input#name.form-control(type='text)\n        button.btn.btn-primary(type='submit') Submit\n    p Hello #{username}`\n    var fn = pug.compile(template);\n    var html = fn({username: input});\n    res.send(html);\n})\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Code Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Code_Injection).\n* Wikipedia: [Code Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection).\n* PortSwigger Research Blog: [Server-Side Template Injection](https://portswigger.net/research/server-side-template-injection).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n",

            "help": "# Server-side URL redirect\nDirectly incorporating user input into a URL redirect request without validating the input can facilitate phishing attacks. In these attacks, unsuspecting users can be redirected to a malicious site that looks very similar to the real site they intend to visit, but which is controlled by the attacker.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against untrusted URL redirection, it is advisable to avoid putting user input directly into a redirect URL. Instead, maintain a list of authorized redirects on the server; then choose from that list based on the user input provided.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows an HTTP request parameter being used directly in a URL redirect without validating the input, which facilitates phishing attacks:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")();\n\napp.get('/some/path', function(req, res) {\n  // BAD: a request parameter is incorporated without validation into a URL redirect\n  res.redirect(req.param(\"target\"));\n});\n\n```\nOne way to remedy the problem is to validate the user input against a known fixed string before doing the redirection:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")();\n\nconst VALID_REDIRECT = \"http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html\";\n\napp.get('/some/path', function(req, res) {\n  // GOOD: the request parameter is validated against a known fixed string\n  let target = req.param(\"target\");\n  if (VALID_REDIRECT === target)\n    res.redirect(target);\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [ XSS Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-601](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html).\n",
